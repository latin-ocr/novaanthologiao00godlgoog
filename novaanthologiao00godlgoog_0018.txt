4 arr-nononis

Sweeter thy voioe, but every sound is sweet;
Myrisds of rivulets hurrying through the lawn,
'Phe moen ol doves in immemorial elms,

And murmuring of innumerable bees.

Κ. Hera Who hath sent thoe now?
Movit. The constable of Franoe.
K. Her. Ι pray thee, bear my former answer baok:
Bid them aohiove me and then soll my bonos.
Good Godl why should they mook poor follows thus?
The man that onos did soll the lion's skin
While the beast liv'd, was kill’d with hunting him.
A many of our bodies shall no doubt
Find native graves ; upon tho which, Ι trust,
Shall witness live in brass ol this day’s work;
And those that leave their valiant bones in Franoe,
Dying like mon, though buried in your dunghills‚
They shall bo fam’d3 for thore the sun shall greet
them, ’
And dravv their honours rosking up to heaven.

Lol me speak proudly: tell the constable,
We are but warriors for the working-day;
Our gayness and our gilt are all besmiroh’d
With rainy marching in the painful field ;
There’s not a pieoe of feather in our host-
Good argument, I hope, wo will not fly-
And time hath worn us into slovonry:

But, by the mass, our hsa1ts are in the irim.
