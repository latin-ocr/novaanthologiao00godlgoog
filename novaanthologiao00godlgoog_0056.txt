And Ι will lay thee in that lovely earth,
And heap a stetely mound above thy bones,
And plant a far-seen pillar over 011,

And men shall not forget thee 111 thy grave.

’ And I will spere thy host; yen, 101 them go!

Let them all eroes the Oxus baolr in peace!

What should Ι (10 with slaying any more?

For would that all whom Ι have ever 010111 ’
Might be 01100 more alive; my bitterest 1000,

Α11(1 they who were oull’d champions in their 111110,
And through whose death Ι won that fame I have,
And I were nothing but 0 common man,

A poor, mean soldier, and without renown;

So thou mightest 1110 100, my son, my sonl

Or rather would that Ι, even Ι myself,

Might now be lying on this bloody saud,

Near death, and by an ignorant stroke 01 1111110,
Not thou 01 1111110; and Ι might die, not thou,
And Ι, not thou, be borne to Seistan ;

’ Α11(1 Ζο1 might weep above my grave, not thine;
And say: ‘O son, I weep thee not too sore,

For willingly, Ι know, thou met'st thine end l’
But now in blood and battles was my youth,

And full 01 blood and battles 10 my age,

And I shall never end this 1110 01 blood.
