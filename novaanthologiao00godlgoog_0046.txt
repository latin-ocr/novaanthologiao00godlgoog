You see me here,

Ae one oi you heth eeid, tn old, unerm'd,
Defenoelese man; end yesterdey you saw me
Presiding in the hall of duoel stete,

Apparent eovereign of our hundred isles,
Robed in offioiel purple, dealing out

The ediots oi a power whioh is not mine,
Nor yourS, but of our masters—the patriciano.

Why I was there you know, or think you know;
Why I am here he who heth been most wrong’d,

He who among you hath been most insulted,
Outroged ond trodden on, until he doubt

If he be worm or no, may enswer for me,
Asking of his own heart what· brought him here?
Yon know my reeent story, all men know it,
And judge of it fer differently from those '
Who eote in judgment to heep soom on soom.
But spere me the reoital-it is here,

Here et my heart, the outrage—but my words,
Alreody spent in unavailing plaintS,

Would only show my foeblenese the more,

And I oome here to strengthen even the strong,
And urge them on to deede, ond not to war

'With women’s weapons.
