132 Anononoere

My heare, not gifts; end like the poor, thet mourn
With green but humble turis, write o’er hie hearee
For false foul prose-'men thie feir truth in verse.
Hore Daphnis elops! aod while tho yreot wotoh goos
Of lond ond rootless Timo, tates hio reposo.

Fame io hut ooiso; all learning] bot o thought,

Which ooo admires, another sote at nouom,-

Notoro mocks both ,· aod wit still keeps odoo:

’ But death trinos knowledge aod ossuroooe too.
Η. VAUGHAN.

Now entertnin conjecture of e time
When oreeping murmur and the poring derk
Fille the wide veeeel of the universe.

From camp to oemp, through the foul womb of night,

The hum of either army etilly soundS,

That the fix’d sentinels almost receive

The secret whiepere of each other’s watch:

Fire enswere fite, and through their paly flames
Eeoh battle sees the other’e umber’d face:

Steed threatene eteed, in high and boastful neighe
Pieroing the night’e dull ear3 end from the tents
The ormontem, oooompliehing the knights,

With busy hemmers closing rivete up,

Give dreadful note of preparation.
The country oooke do orow, the olooks do toll,

And the third hour oi drowsy morning nome.
