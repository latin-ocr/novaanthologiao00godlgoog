XLVIII

(lauat. ΟΞ tc what purpose dost thou heard thy
werde,
'Phat thou return'st no greeting to thy friends?
Bolioy. I heve too few to take my leave of you,
When the tongue’s office should be prodigal
To breathe the abundent dolour of the heart
Gaunt. Thy grief is but thy absence for a time.
Boliny. Joy absent, grief is present for that time.
Gaowt. What is six wintere? they are quickly gone.
Bolhcy. Το men in j0y; but grief makes one hour
ten.
Gauct. Call it a trevel thet thou tak’st for pleasure.
Boltop. My heart will sigh when I miscell it se,
Which finds it an enforced pilgrimage.
(lauat. 'Phe sullen passage of thy weary steps
Esteem a foil wherein thou art to set
The precious jewel of thy home return.
Boliap. Nay, rather, every tedicus stride 1 make
Will but remember me what a deal of world
I wander from the jewels that I love.
Must I not serve a long apprentieehood
To foreign passages, and in the end,
Having my freedom, boast of nothing else
But that I was a journeyman to grief ἱ)
(lauet. All places that the eye of heaven visits
Are to a wiso man ports and happy herens.
Teech thy necessity to reason thus;

There is no virtue like necessity.

Think nottho king did banish thee,
But thou the king. Woe doth the heavier sit,

Where it perceives it is but faintly borne.
