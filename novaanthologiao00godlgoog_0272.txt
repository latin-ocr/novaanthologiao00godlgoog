ANTHOLOGIA

No forest fell
When thou wouldst build3 no quarry sent ita atores
To enrioh thy walls: but thou didst how the floodS,
And make thy- marble of the glaeey ware.
In auch a palaea Aristaeus found
Cyrene, when ho bore the plaintive tale
Of hie lost bees to her maternal ear.
In auch a palare Poetry might place
The armoury of winter; where his troop5‚
The gloomy clouds, find weapona, arrowy sleet,
Skinpieroing voUey‚ bloseom-bruising hail.
Silently aa a dream the fabrio rose;
No sound of hammer or of saw was there:
Ioe upon ioe, the well-adjueted parts ,
Were soon oonjoined, nor other rement asked
Thon water interfuaed to make them one.
Lampe gratefully dieposed, and of althaea,
Illumined every side: awatery light
Gleamed through the olear transparenoy, that seemed
Another moon new-risen, or meteor fallen
From heaven to earth, of lambent fleme sereno.
OOWPER.
