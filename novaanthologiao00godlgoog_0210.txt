For the ungodly said, reasoning with themselves
but not aright, Our life is short and tediouS, and in the
death of a man there is no remedy: neither was there
any man known to have returned from the grave. For
we arc born at all adventure: and we shall be hereafter
as though we had never been: for the breath in our
nostrils is as smoke, anda little spark in the moving of

our· heart: which being extinguished‚ our body shall be ¹

turned into ashes, and our spirit shall vanish as the soft
air. Iret us crown ourselves with rose-buds, before they
be withered: let none of us go without his part of our
voluptuousness: let us leave tokens of our joyfulness

CXXIV

These hours, that with gentle work did frame

The lovely gaze where every eye deth dwell,

Will play the tyrants to 1110 very same

And that unfair which fairly doth exeel;

For neverresting time leads summer on

To hideous winter, and confounds him there;

Sap check’d with frost, and lusty leaves quite gone,

Beauty o’ersnow’d and bareness every where:

Thon, were not summer's distillation left,

A liquid prisoner pent in walls of glass,

Beauty’s effect with beauty were horest,

Nor it, nor no remembranee what it was:
But fiowers distill’d‚ though they with winter meet,
Loese but their show; their substance still lives sweet.
