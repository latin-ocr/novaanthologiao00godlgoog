Gol-thou mi all unfit to share
The pleesures of this place

With such as its old tenente are,
Oreetures of geniler race.

The squirrel here his heard provides,
Awere of winiry storme3

And woodpeekers explere the sides
Of rugged oeks for worma

The sheep here smooihes the knotted dhorn
With frictione of her fleeee;

And here I wander eve and mom,
Like her, a friend to peace.

Ah !·-I eould pity the exiled
From this secure retreat ;—

I would not lose it 1ο be styled
The happiest of the great.

But thou canet teste no calm delight3
Thy pleasure ie to show

Thy magnanimity in sight,
Thy nomed-therefore, go!

I eere not whether east or north,
So 1 no more may find thee;

The ang1y Muse thus singe thee forbh,
And cleps the gete behind thee.
