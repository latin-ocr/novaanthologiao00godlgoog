Ι will not leave the emouldering pyro:
Enough 'remains to light again:

Bur who am I to dare desire
A plnoe beside the king of men?

So burnt my deor Oeohelinn town3
And 1 an outeast gazed and groened.
But, when my lather’s roof fell down,

l'or all that wrong eweel love otoned.

He led me trembling lo the ship,
He seemed at lost to love me then ;
He soothed, he olosped me lip to lip:
How strange, to wed lhe king of menl

I linger, orphan, widow‚ slav03
I lived when sire and brethren died.

Oh, had Ι shared my mother’s grave,
Or olomb unto lhe hero's side!

rhet comrade old hath made hio moan;
The centaur oowers within his den:

And Ι abido to guard alone
'Phe ashes ol the king of men.

Alone, beneoth the night divine-
Alone, another weeps elsewhere:

Her love for him is unlike mine,
Her wail she will nollet me share.

W. Jonsou.
