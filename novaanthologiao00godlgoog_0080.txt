ANTHOLOGIA

Reaeon thus with Life:

If Ι do lose thee, I do lose a thing

Thet none but foole would keep: ebreeth thou ert,
Servile to 1111 the skyey influenees,

Thet do thie hebitotion5 where thou keep’et,

Hourly efflicte Merely‚ thou ert Death’s fool;

For him thou lebour’et by thy ssight to shun,

And yet run'st toward him still Thou art not noble:
For all the eooommodetions that thou beer’et

Are nurs'd by baseness. Thou ’rh by no meane valiant:
For thou dost feer the soft and tendor fork

Of a poor worm. Thy best of rest ie eleep,

And that thou oft provok’st: yet grossly feer'et

Thy death, whioh ie no more. Thou ’rt not thyself:

For thou exist'et on many e thousand grains

Thoe issue out of duob. Happy thou art not:

For what thou hest not, still thou striv'st to get,
And what thou host, forget’st. 'I'hou art not certain:
For thy complexion shiste to strange effecte,

After the moon. 1f thou art rich, thou’rt poor:

For, like an ees whose book with ingote bewe,

[hou beer’et thy heavy riohes but a journey,

And Deeth unloads thee. Friend haet thou none;
For thino own bowels, which do call ohee sire,

The mere effusion of thy proper loine‚

Do curse the gout, serpig0, end the rheum,
