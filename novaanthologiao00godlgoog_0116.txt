ANTHOLOGIA

mn

Loiton'ng and leaping,

with saunter, with bounde—
Fliekering and circling

In filos and in rounds-

Gaily their pinestaff green
Tossing in air,

Loose 0’0r their shoulders white
Showering their hai-r-

seo! the wild Maenads
Break from the wood,
Youth and Iacchus
Maddening their blood!

See! through the quiet land

Rioting they pass-

Fling the fresh heaps about,
Trample the grass!

Tear from the rifled hedgo
GarlandS, their prize:

Fill with their sporta the field,
Fill with their eries!

Shepherd, what ails thee then?
Shephord‚ why mute?

Forth with thy joyous song}
Forth with thy flute!

Tempts not the revel blithe?
Lure not their eries?

Glow not their shoulders smooth‘?
