64 Anrrronocn

Willing to wound, end yet afraid to striks,
Just hinc s fault, end hesitete dislike3

Alike reserved to blame, orto commend,

A timorous foe, end e suspicions hiend;
Dreading even fools, by fletterers besieged,
And so obliging, thet he ne’er obliged3

Like Octo, give his little Senste lewe.

And sit attentive to his own eppleus03
While wits end templars ev’ry sentence mise,

And wonder with e foolish fece of pratee:-
Who but must leugh, if such o man there he?
Who would not weep if Atticus were he?

He esked, but all the heavenly quire stood mute,
And silence was in Hoeven: on Man's behelf
Patron or intercessor none appeared-

Muoh less thot durst upon his own head drew
The deedly forfeiture, and ransom set.¹

And now without redemption all mankind
Mustheve beenlost, odjudged to Death end Hell
By doom severe, hed not the Sonos cod,

ln whom the fulness dwslls of love divine,

His dcarest mediation thus renewed t·—

‘sacher thy word is passed, Man shall find grece3
And shall Graes not find means, thet finds her wey,
The speediest of thy winged messengers,

To visit all thy creatures, end to all

Comes unprovented, unimplored, unsoughti' ,
