Father‚ sorbear: for Ι but meet today
The doom that at my birth was written down
In Heaven, and thou art Heaven’s uneonseious hand.
Surely my heart oried out that it was thou,
When first Ι saw thee; and thy heart spoke too,
Ι know it: but Fate trod those promptings down
Under its iron heel; Fato, Pate engaged
The strife, and hurled me on my lather’s spear.
But let us speak no more of this: Ι find
My father; let me feel that I have found.
Come, sit beside me on this sand, and take
My head between thy hands, and kiss my oheeks‚
And wash them with thy tenne, and say, ‘My Sonl’
Quiekt quiekl ior numbered are my sande of life,
And swiit3 for like the lightning to this field
Ι same, and like the wind I go away—
Sudden and swift, and like a passing wind.

Bnt it was writ in Heaven that this should be.

Ι burst the chain, Ι sprang into the boat.

Seven days Ι drove along the dreary deep,

And with me drove the moon and all the stars;
And the wind fell, and on the seventh night

Ι heard the shingle grinding in the surge,
And felt the boat shoek earth, and looking up,

Behold, the enehanted towers of Carbonek,

A eastle like a roek upon a rook,

With ohaem-like portale open to the sea,

And steps that met the breaker ; there was none
