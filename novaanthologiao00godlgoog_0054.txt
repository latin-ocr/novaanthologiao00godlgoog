ANTHOLOGIA

Low, like onothera, lies the lourelled head:

The life that seemed c perfect song is o'er:
Ocrry tho laet great bord to his last bert

Lcnd that he loved, thy noblest voice is mute.
Land thot he lovod, that loved himl nevermore
Meadow of thino, smooth lcwn or wild eea-shore,
Gardene of odorous bloom and tremuloue fruit,
Or woodlcnde old, like Druid couches sproacl
The master'e feet shall troad.

Death's little rift hath rent the faultless lute:
The singer of undying songs ie dead.

Lo, in this ueaeon pensive-hued and grave,
While fades and falle the doomed, reluctant leof
From withered Earth's fantastic coronal,

With wondering sighe of forest ond 0111010
Mingles the murmur of a peopleâ€™e grief

For him whose leof shall fade not, neither foll.
He heth fared forth, beyond theco sune and ehowers.

Fon us, the autumn glou, the autumn fiame,
And soon the winter silence shall be oure:

Him the eternal spring of fcdeless fame

Orowne with no mortcl flowers.
W. WA'ISON.
