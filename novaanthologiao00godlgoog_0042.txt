So all night long upon the sandy shores

I heard 1110 hollow murmur of 1110 ware,
And all night long 1110 hidden seaeaves made
A ghostly eoh03 and 1110 sea-birds mewed
Around me; onoe 1 heard a mooking laugh
As of some soornful Nereid: once 1110 waters
Broke louder on 1110 soarped 10010, and ebbed
As 111110 monster coming: but again

He earne 1101, and the dead moon sank, end still
Only upon 1110 011110 the walls, 1110 01101110,
And I forsaken on my sea-worn rook,

And lo, 1110 monster-haunted depths 01000.
Τ11101 1110 dead dark hour before 1110 down,

When siok men die, and scarcely 1001110011

Βο10 up my weary eyelids, 0 great surge
Β111010111110 reeh, and slowly, 0011000111θά,

The sea sueked downwards 1ο 110 depths, laid bare
'Phe hidden reefs, and then before my eyes—-

Oh 1011110101 a huge and loathsome snake

Listed his dreadful 01001 and soaly side

Above the waves, in bulk and length οο large,
Coil 01101 hideous 0011, that 000100 the eye

Gould measure 110 full horror; 1110 great jeyvs
Dropped as with gore; the large and furious eyes
Were fired with blood and lust.
