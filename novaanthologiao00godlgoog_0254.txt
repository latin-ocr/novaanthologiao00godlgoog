ort hnet thou seen bolos of the thunder hurled
As from thy threehold3 day by day hest been
A little lower then the ehilly sheen
Of ioy pinnecloe; now, es deep profound

Ι As these are high, descend! He ne’er is orowned
With immortality, who foere to follow
Whore airy voioes lead: so through the hollow,
The silent mysteriee of earth descend 1’

It must be-

And yet it moves me, Romans! it oonfounds
'l'ho oounsele of my firm philosophy,

That Ruin's meroiless ploughshare must paee 0'er,
And barren eald be sown on yon proud oidy.

Ae on our olive-orowned hill we stand,

Where Kedron et our feet its soanby wetere
Distils from stone to stone with genble motion,
Ae through a velley secred to sweeb peace,

How boldly doth it front uel how mejestioelly! Ι
Like a luxurious vineyerd, the hill-side

Is hung with marble fabrice, line o'er line,

Terraoe o’er terreae, nearer still, and nearer

To the blue heavenn.
