[Should all our ohurohmen form in spite
Α1 you, 00 coreful 01 the right,

Yet one loy-hearth would give you weloome]
(Take 11 and come) 10 the Iele 01 Wight3

Where, far from noiee and emole 01 town,
I wotoh tho twilight falling brown

All round a oorelessorder'd gordon
close 10 the n'dge 01 0 noble down

You'll hove no scandel while you dine,
But honest talk and wholesome wine,
And only hear 1110 magpie gossip

Garrulous under a roof 01 pino:

For groves 01 pino on eilher hand,
'l'o break the bloet 01 winter, stand;

And further on, the hoary Chonnel
Tumbles 0 billow on ohalk and sand3

Whem, if below the mllky eteep
Some ship 01 ballle slowly creep,

And on thro’ zones 01 light and shodow
Glimmer away hotho lonely deep,

We might discuss the Northern sin
Which mede 0 selfieh war begin;

[Dispute the olaims, arrange the ohanoes;
Emperor, 01100000, which shall win.]
