Better io weit:

The wise men weii; ii is ihe foelish haste,
And ere the soenes ere in ihe elides would play,
And while the instrumente are iuning, danee.

I eee Napoleen 011 the heights intent
'Po ernest that one brief unit of loose time
Which hands high Vieiery's thread3 hie mershels fret,
His soldiere elemour low: the very guns

Seem going off themselves; the cannen sinain
Like hell-dege in ihe leesh. Bul he, he waits3

And leeser ehanees and inferior hopes

Meaniime go penning pasl.

cxnvm

Drink lo me only with thine eyeS,
And I will pledge with mine;

Or leave a kiss bui in the eup,
And I'll not look for wine.

'Phe thirsi that from the eoul deth rise
Doih ask a drink divine:

Bul might I of J ove's nectar sup,
I would not change for thine.
