For ending theo no sooner. Thou hast nor youth nor age:
But, as it were, an afterslinner’s slesp

Dreaming on both; for all thy blessed youth
Beoomes as agad, and doth beg the nlms

of palsied eld: and when thou art old and rieh
Thou hest neither heat, affection, limb, nor beauty,
To make thy riohes pleasant. What ’s yet in this
That bears the name of Life? Yet in this Life
Lie hid moe thousand deaths. Yet Doath we fear,
That makes these odds all even.

No, Time, thou shalt not boast that I do change:
Thy pyramide built up with newer might

To me are nothing novel, nothing strange;

They are but dressings of a former sight.

Our dates are brief, and therefore we admire
What thou dost foist upon us that is old;

And rather make them born to our desire

Thau think that we before have heard them told.
Thy registers and theo Ι both dofy,

Not wondering at the present nor the past,

For thy reeords and what we see deth lie,

Made more or less by thy continual haste.
This Ι do voro, and this shall ever be;

Iwill be true, despite thy seythe and thee.
