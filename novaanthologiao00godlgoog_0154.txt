LXXXIV

K. Edw. Ah, Leieester, weigh how hardly Ι oen brook
To lose my orown end kingdom without cause ;
To give ambitione Mortimer my righh,

That like a mountain overwhelms my bliss,
In which extremes my mind here murdered is.
But what vhe heavens appoint, I must obey!
Here, take my orown; the life oi Edwsrd too;
Two kings in England cannot reign at onoe.
But siey swhile‚ leh me be king sill night,
Thai I may gaze upon this glittering orown3
So shall my eyes receive their lest content,
My head, she istest honour due to it,

And jointly both yield up their wished right.
Continue ever, thou celestisl sun ;

Let never silent night possess this olime:
Siand still, you watches of the elemeni3

All times and sermone, rest you at a stay,
That Edward may be still fair England’s king!

But dey's bright boam doth venish fast away,

And needs Ι musi resign my wished orown.
Inhuman creaturos! nursed with higer's milk!
Why gspe you for your sovereign's overthrow?
My diadem 1 mean, and guililess lif .

See, monsters, see, I'll wear· my orown again!
ufflows.
