O’er the smooth ensmelled green,
Where no print of step harh been,
Follow me, ae I sing
And touoh the warbled string,
Under the shady roof
Of brenehing elm sienproof.
Follow me;
I will bring you where she sits,
ulad iu splendour as befits
Her deity.
Such a rural queen
All Arcadia heth not seen.

Nymphs and shepherde, danos no more
By sandy Ludon’s lilied benks3
On old Lycaone, or Oyllene hoar,
Trip no more in twflight ranks3
Though Erymanth your loss deplere,
A better soil shall give ye thanke.
From ‘ohe stony Maenalus
Bring your flooks, and live with us3
Here ye shull have mater grace,
To serve the lady oi this place.
Though Syriux your Pan's mistress were,
Yet Syrinx well might weit on her.

Such a rurnl queen
All moedis heth not seen.
