CLXXII

He was my friend, the truost friend on oanh3
Α strong ond mighty influonoo join’d our birth3
Nor did wo envy the most sounding namo

By friondship giv’n of old to famo.

Nono but his brothren ho, and sistens know,
Whom tho kind youth proforr'd to mo;
And ov’n in that wo did agmo,

For muoh above myoolf I lov’d thom too.

Say, for you saw uo, yo immortol lignos,
How oft unwooriod have wo spent tho nights?
Till the Ledaeon storo, so fam’d for love,
Wondemd at us from above.
We spent thom notin hoyo, in lusto, or wino;
But search of deep philosophy,
wit, eloquonoo, and poetry‚
Anto whioh I Iov'd‚ for thoy, my friend, wore thino.

CLXXIII

Under tho wido and stany sky

Dig tho gravo and lot mo lio;

Glad did 1 lIvo and gladly dio,
And 1 laid mo down with a will.

Thisbe tho verso you gravo for mo:

‘Horo ho lios where ho longod to bo3

Home is the soilor, homo from seo,
And the huntor homo from the hill.'
