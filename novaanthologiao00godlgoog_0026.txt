ANTHOLOGIA

These bad traditione of comedy affect us not only on
the stage, but in our literature, and may be tracked into
our sccial life. They are the ground of the heavy
moralizings by which we are outwearied, about Life as
a Comedy, and Comedy as a jado, when popular writerS,
conscicus cf fatigue in creativeness‚ desire to be cogent in
a modieh cynicism : perversione of the idea cf life, and of
the proper esteem for the society we have wrested from

brutishnesS, and would carry higher. Stock images of

this description are accepted by the timid and sensitiva,
as well as by the saturnine, quite seriously3 lor not
many look abroad with their own eyes, fewer still have
the habit of thinking for themselves. Life, we know too
well, is not a Comedy‚ but something strangely mixed3
nor is Comedy a vile mask. The corrupted importation
from Franco was noricus 3 a noble entertainment spoilt
to suit the wretched taste of a villainous age; and the
later imitatione of it, partly drained of its poison and
made decorous, became thesemo, notwithstanding their
fun, in the perpetual recurring of the same situations,
owing to the absence of original study and vigour of
conception.
