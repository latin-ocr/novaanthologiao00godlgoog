Οὐράνιον μίμημα γενεθλιακοῖοιν ἐν ὥραις

τοῦτ’ ἀπὸ Νειλογενοΰς δέξο Λεωνίδεω,
Πονπαίο, Διὸς εὖνι, Σεβαστιάς· εὔαδε γάρ σοι

δῶρα τὰ καὶ λέκτρων ἄξια καὶ σοφίης.

Νο1111111 I praise, who from the world retired,
By nc enIIVening genercus passion fired,

On flowery couches elumbers life away

And gently bide his active powers deccy3
th fears bright glory's awful face to see,
And shuns rencwn as much ee infamy:

But blest is he, wh0‚ exercised in caree,

Το private leisure public vi1³cue bears3

Who tranquil ends the rece he 110ny run,
And decks repcse with trophies labour wcn.
Him honour follows to che secret shede,
And crcwns propitious his declining head;
In his retreat their harpe the Muses string,
For him in lays unbought spontaneous eing;

’ Friendship and truth on all his momente weit,

Pleaeed with retirement better than with state3
And round the bower where humblygreet he lies

’ Fair clives blccm‚ or verdant leurels rise.
¹ mnemon.
