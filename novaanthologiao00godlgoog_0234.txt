ANTHOLOGIA

CXL

O fountains, when in you shall Ι .
Myself‚ eased of unpeaeeful thoughts, espy?
Ofields! 0 woodsl when, when shall 1 be made
The happy tenant of your shade‘?
Here 's the spring-head of Pleasure's flood;

Where all the riehes lie, that she
Has eoin’d and stamp’d for good.

Pride and Ambition here

Only in far-feteh'd metaphors appear:

Here nought but winds ean hurtful murmure seatter‚
And nought but Eeho fiatter.
The Gods, when they deseended‚ hither

From Heaven did always ehoose their way3

And therefore we may boldly say

That ’tis the way teo thither.

How happy here should Ι
And one dear She live and embraeing die!
She who is all the world, and ean exclude

In deserte solitudo.

I should have then this only fear,
hest men, when they my pleasures see,

Should all come im’tate me,
And so make a city here. “
