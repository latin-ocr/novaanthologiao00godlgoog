Set where the upper streame of Simois flow

Was the Palladium, high ’mid roek and wood;
And Hector was in Ilium, fer below,

And fought, end saw it not—but there it stoodl
It stood, end sun and moonshine rained their light
On the pure columns of ite glen-built hall,
Berkwerd and forward rolled the waves of fight
Round Troy—but while this stood, Troy eould not fell.
So, in its lovely moonlight, lives the soul.
Mountaine eurround it, and sweet virgin εἰη

Oold, pleshing pest it, erystel wetere roll;

We visit it by momente, eh, teo reret

We shall renew the battle on the plain
'Pe-morrow:—red with blood will Xanthus be;
Hector and Ajex will be there again,

Helen will eome upon the wells to see.

Still doth the soul from its lone fastuose high
Upon our life a ruling effluenee eend3

And when it soils, fight as we will, we die;

And while it laete, we cannot wholly end.

Seli-reverence, sels-knowledge, sels-oontroh

These three alone lead life to sovereign power.
Yet not for power-power of itself

Would oome unealled for—but to live by law,
Aeting the law we live by, without foer:
And beoeuee right ie right, to follow right

Were wisdom‚ in the seorn ef consequence.
