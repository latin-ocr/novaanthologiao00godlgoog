For some were hung with erres green end blue,
Showing e gaudy summer-mern,

Where with puff'd eheek the belted hunter blew
His wresthed buglehorn.

One seem'd all dark and red—a tract of send,
And some one peeing there alone,

Who pneed for ever in a glimmering land,
Lit with a lew large moon.

One shovrd an iren coest end engry weves.
You seem'd to hear them climb and fall
And rear reeh-thwarted under bellowing neves,

Beneath the windy walL

And one, atuh-fed river winding slew
By herds upon an endless plain,

The ragged rime of thunder brooding low,
With shedowstreaks of rein.

And one, the reapers st their sultry toil.
In frent they bound the sheeves. Behind

Were realms of upland, prodigal in eil,
And hoery to the wind.

And one a foreground blaek with stenes and slsgs,
Beyond‚ a line oi heights, and higher

All barr’d with long white eloud the seornful erags
And highest, snow and fire.

And one, an English home-gray twilight pour’d
On dewy pastures dewy trees,

Softer then sleep—ell things in order steret,
Α haunt of ancient Peaee.
