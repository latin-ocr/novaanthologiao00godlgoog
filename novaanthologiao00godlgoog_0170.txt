xc11

Oh Friendship, eordinl of the human bresst!
So little felt, so fervently professedl

Thy blossoms deok our unsuspeoting years3
The promise of delioious fruit appears:

But soon, alas, we find the resh mistake

That sanguine inexperienoe loves to make,
And view with tesrs the expected harvest lost,
Deoayed by time or withered by a frost

⁸ Whoever undertakes a friend’s great part
should be renewed in nature, pure in heert,
Propered for martyrdom, und strong to prove
A thousand ways the forne of genuine love.
He may be oolled to give up heelth and gain,
To exchenge oontent for trouble, ease for pain,
'Io eoho sigh for sigh, end grean for green,
And wet his oheeks with sorrows not his own.
The heert of man, for such e tesk too frnil,
When most relied on, is most sure to fail3
And, summoned to purteke its fellow's woe,

Starts from its office, like a broken bow.

God of the varied bow,

God of the thousand eyes,

From all the winde thet blow,·
Thy praises rise.
