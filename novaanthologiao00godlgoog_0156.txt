Birds in the high Han-gardan

When twilight was falling,
Mami, Maud‚ Maud, Maud‚
They were erying and calling.

Where was Maud? in our wood;
And Ι, who else, was with her,
Gethering woodlnnd lilios,

Myriads blow together.

Birds in our wood sang
Ringing thro’ the valleye,

Maud ie here, here, here
In among the liliee.

I kiss’d her elender hand,
She took the kisssedat0153

Maud ie noi seventeen‚
But she ie tall and siately.

Ito cry out on pride
Who have won her favour!
Ο Maud were sure of heaven
If lowliness could eave her.

I know the way she went
Home with her maiden posy,

For her feet have touch’d the meedows
And left the daisies roey. ¹

Birde in the high Hallgarden
Were erying and calling te her,

Where is Maud, Maud, Maud‘?
One is come to woo her.
