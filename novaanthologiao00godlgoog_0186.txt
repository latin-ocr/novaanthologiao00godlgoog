Are not our lowing heifers sleeker than
Night·swollen mushrooms? Are not our wide plains
Speokled with countless fleeces? Have not rains
Green'd over April’s lap‘? No howling sad

Siokens our fearful ewos3 and we have had

Great bounty from Endymion our lorti!

Orsino, noble sir,

Β9 pleas'd that Ι shake off these names you give me:
Antonio never yet was thiel or pirate,
Though I confess on base and ground enough,

Orsino’s enemy. A witohoralt drew me hither:

That most ingrateful bey there by your side,

From the rude sea’s enrag’d and foamy mouth
Did Ι redeem; a wreok past hope he was:
His life I gave him, and did thereto add

My love, without retention or restraint

All his in dedication; for his sake

Did I exposa myself, pure for his love,

Into the danger ol this adverse town;

Drew to defend him when 119 was beset:
Where being apprehended‚ his false cunning,
Not meaning to partake with me in danger,
Taught him to faoe me out of his acquaintance,
And grew a twenty years removed thing

While one would wink.
