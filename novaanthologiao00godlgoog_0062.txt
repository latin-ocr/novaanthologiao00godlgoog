Tyr. The tyrannous and bloody act is done;
The most arch dead of pitacus massacrc
'rhet ever yet thia land was guilty of.
Dighton and Forreat, whom I did suborn
To do this piace of ruthleas butchery,
Albeit they were flesh’d villarino, bloody dogs,
Melting with tenderness and mild compassion,
Wept like to children in their death'e sad story.
‘Ohl thus,’ quoth Dighton‚ ‘lay the gentle babesz’

“Phua thua’ quoth Forrest‚ ‘girdling one another
Within their alabaster innocent arms:

Their lips were four red rosea on a etalk,
Which in their summer beauty kiee’d each other.

A book of prayere on their pillow lay ;

Which once,' quoth Forreet ‘almost chang'd my mind3
But, 0, the devil’-there tho villain stopp'd; Ι
When Dighton thus told on: ‘We smothered ⁷

The most repleniehed eweet work of nature, ’

That from the prime creation e’er she fram’d.'

Hence bethara gono with conscience and remorae ;
They could not epeak3 and eo I leit them both,
To bear this tidings to the bloody king.

emmeram.
