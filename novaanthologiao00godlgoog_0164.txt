Ay an’ thy muther says thou wants to marry the lass,

Proputty, proputty’s iwything ’ere, an', Smmy, I'm blest

If it isn’t the sazima oop yonder, fur them as ’as it’s

Tis’n them as 'as munny as breaks into ’ouses an' steals, .

Them as ’as conta to their baoks an’ taakes their regular

Noa, but it 's themasniver knaws wheerameffl 's to be ’ad.

Tazike my word for it, Smmy, bhe poor in a loomp

Them or thir seythers, tha sees, mun ’a betina lassizy lot,

For work mun ’a gone to tho gittin’ whiniver munny

But 'e tued an’ moil’d ’issem dead, an ’e died a good

Foyther run 00p to the farm, an’ I runs oop to the mill;

An' I’ll run oop to the brig, an' that thou 'll live to soe;

And if thou marries a good un I'll leiive the land to

Thim ’s my noationS, Sammy‚ wheerby I means to stiek;

But if thou marries a bad un, Ι 'll leave the land to Dick

TENNYSON.
