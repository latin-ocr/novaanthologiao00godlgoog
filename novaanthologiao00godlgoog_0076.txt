Ο Patriot Statcsman, bs thou wiso to know

Tho limits of resistance, and the bounds
Datcrmining concession; still ba bold

Not only to slight praisa‚ but suffer scorn:

ο And be thy haart a fortnass, to maintain

The day against the moment, and the year
Against tho day: thy voice, a music, heard
Through all the yolls and countsr-yolls of saud
And faction; and thy will, a power to make
This over-changing world of circumstance

In changing, chime with noverchanging Law.

And born to write, convorso, and live with cass:
Should such aman, too fond to rulo alone,
Boar, like tho Turk, no brothor naar tho throno,
View him with scornful, yet with jaalous oyes,
And hato for arts that caused himself to risa ;
Damn with faint praisc, assant with civil 1661,
And, without snecring, toach the rost to snoor3
