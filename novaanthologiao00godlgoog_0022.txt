ANTHOLOGIA

v
Let your shows be new as strange,

Lot them 0st and sweetly vmy:
Lot them haste eo to their change

As the neers may not terry.
Τοο long t’ expect the pleesing'st sight
Doth take away from the delight
All seur and eullep looks away,
'l'hat are the servants of the day:
Our sporta are of the humorous Nighty
Who feeds the spere that give her light,

And useth then her went more bright‚
Το help the Vision of Delight.

See, see, her seeptro and her erown

' Are all of fleme, and from her gown

Ι Α train of light eomes waving down.
'I'hie night in dew eho will not eteep
The brein, nor loek the sense in eleep:
But all awake with phantoms keep,
And those te make Delight more deep.

Jonson.
