Vio. Ay, bui Ι know,-

Duke. What dost thou know?
Vio. Too well whei love women io men moy owe:
In saith, they ere ae true of heeri ae we.
My iether had e daughter loved a man,
Ae it might be, perhepS, were Ι a woman,
Ι should your lordship.
Dulce. And what ’e her history?
Vio. Α blank, my lord. She never told her love,
But lei concealment, like a worm i’ the bud,
Feed 011 her demaek cheek: she pin’d in thought,
And with a green end yellow melancholy‚
She eei like Patienoe on monument,
Smiling at grief. Was not this love indeed?
We men moy say more, ewear more; bui indeed
Our shows ere more than will, for still we prove
Muoh in our voyre, but little in our love.
Dulce. But died thy sister oi her love, my boy?
Vio. 1 am all the daughters of my father's house,
And all the brothers too; and yet 1 know not. ,
Sir, shall Ι to this lady?
Dulce. Ay, ihai's the theme.
Το her in haste ; give her thisjewe13 say

My love oen give no place, bide no delay.
mmmm
