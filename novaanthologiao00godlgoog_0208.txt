ANTHOLOGIA

cxx11
'I'o me most happy therefore he appears
who, having once, unmoved by hopes or fears,
Surveyed this sun, earth, ocean, clouds, and fleme,
Wcil satisfied returns from whence he came.
Is life an hundred years or e’er so few,
’Tis repetition all and nothing new;
Α fair, where thousands meet, but none can stay3
An inn, where travellers bait, then post away;
A sea, where man perpetually is test,
Now plunged in business, now in trifies lost:
th leave it first, the peaeeful port first gain3

Hold then, nor forther launoh into the main ;

Oontract your sails; life nothing can bestow

By long continuance, but continued wce:
The wretched privilege deily to deplore
The funereis of our friends, who go before;
Diseases‚ paine, anxieties and suares,

And age surrounded with a thousand cares.
Β. JENYNS.
