When winds that move iret its oslm surisoe sweep

'Phe azure ses, I love the lond no more:
'Phe smiles of the serene and tranquil deep
Tempt my unquiet mind-But when the rosr
Of ooean’s grey abyss resounds, and foam
Gathers upon the ses, and vast waves burst,
I turn from the dresr aspect to the home
Of earth snd its deep woods, where, interspersed,
ι When winde blow loud, pines make sweet melody ;
Whose house is some lone bork, whose toil the sea,
Whose prey the wandering fish, sn evil lot

ins nosen-surr my languid nmss win fling

Benesth the plane, where the brook's murmuring
Moves the oslm spirit but disturbs it not.

From feirest orestures we desire increase,
Thst thersby benuty’s rose might never die,
But ss the riper should by time decesso,
His tender heir might bear his memory:
But thou, oontrsoted to thino own bright eyes, “
Feed'st thy light's flsme with seli-substantia] fuel,
Making a famine where abundanoe lies,
Thyseli thy foe, to thy sweet sels too oruel.
Thou thst art now the world’s fresh ornament
And only herald to the gaudy spring,
Within thino own bud burisst thy oontent
And, tendor ohurl, msk'st waste in niggarding.

Pity the world, or else this glutton be,

To eat the world’s due, bytho grave and thee.
