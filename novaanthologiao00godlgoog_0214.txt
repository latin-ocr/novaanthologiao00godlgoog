Stood near it but a lion on eaoh side
That kept the entry, sud the moon was full.
Then from the boat I leapt, and up the stairs ;

'l‘here drew my swerd. With sudden-floring manes
These two great beasts rose upright like a man,

anh gript a shoulder‚ and I stood between.

CXXVII

Ο ancient streame, O far-deseended woods,

Full of the fluttering of melodious souls;

Ο hills and valleys that adorn yourselves

In solemn jubilation3 winds and clouds

Ocean and land in stormy nuptiale olasped,

And all exuberant ereatures that aeolaim

The earth’s divine renewal ; lo! I too

With yours would mingle somewhat of glad song;
I too have come through wintry terrers—yea,
Through tempest and through cataclysm of seul
Have come and am delivered. Me the spring,

Me also dimly with new life hath touched

And with regenerato hope, the salt of life;

And I would dedicate these grateful tears

'Po whatsoever· power beneficent—

Veiled though his oountenanoe, undivulged his thought—
Hath led me from the haunted darkness forth
Into the graeious air and vernal mern,

And suffers me to know my spirit a note

Of this great chorus, one with bird and stream

And voieeful mountain.
