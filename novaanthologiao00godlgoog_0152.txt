LXXXIII

There in hie noiey mansion, skilled to rulo,

The village master taugh‘t hie little eohool.

A man severe he wae and etern to vievv'3

I knew him well and every truant knew:

Well had the boding tremblere learned to traoe
The day's disasters in hie morning face3

Full well they laughed with counterfeited glee
At all his jokea-for many a johe had he;

Full well the busy whisper‚ oiroling round,
Gonveyed the diemal tidinge, when he frowned:
Yet he wae kind; or if severe in aught,

The love he bore to learning was in fault.

The village all declared how muoh he knew-
'Twae certain he oould write and oypher too;
Lands he oould measure, terme and tides presago,
And even the story ran that he oould gange.

In arguing too the parson owned his ekifl,

For even though vanquished, he could argue still;

γ While words oi learned length and thundering eound

Amazed the gazing rustice ranged 01001111-
And still they gazed, and still the wonder grew

, That one small head could oarry all he knew. ·
