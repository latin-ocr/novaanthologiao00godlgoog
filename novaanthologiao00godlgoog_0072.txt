XXXIII

'ro me most happy therefore he appears

who, having onoe, unmoved by hopes or feare,
Surveyed this sun, earth, ocean, olouda and fleme,
Well eatiefied returns from whenoe he oame.

Is life an hundred years or e’er eo few,

’ris repetition all and nothing new;

A fair, where thousande meet, but none ean stay;
An inn, where travellere bait, then post away;

A eea, where manperpetually istest,

Now plunged in business² now in trifies lost:
Who leave it first, the peaoeful port firet gain;
Hold then, nor farther launeh into the main3
Oontraot your eaile ; life nothing oen beetow

By 'long continuanee, but continued woe:

The wretched privilege daily to deplore
The funerale of our friends, who go before;

Dieeaeea paine, anxietiee and snaree,

And age eurrounded with a thousand caree.
