The ev’ning cool, when he, from wrath more cool,
Came, the mild judge and intercessor both,

Το sentence man: the voice of God they heard

Now walking in the gardan, by soft winde

Brought to their ears, while day declin'd; they heard,

And from his presence hid themselves among
The thickest trees, both man end wife, till God
Approaching thus to Adam call'd cloud.

CXXXV

Come, come ; no time for lamentation now,

Nor much more cause; Samson hath quit himself
Like Samson, and heroically hath finish’d

A life heroic, on his enemies

Fully reveng’d; hath left them years of mourning,
And lamentation to the sons of Gaphtor,

Through all Philistian bounds; to Israel
Honcur hath left, and freedom, let but them

Find courage to lay hold on this occasion;

'Po himself and father’s house eternal fame;
And, which is best and happiest yet, all this
With eod not parted from him, as was fear’d,

But favouring and assisting to the end.

Nothing is here for aas, nothing to wan

Or knock the breast3 no weakness‚ no contempt,
Dispraise, or blame; nothing but well and fair,

And what may quiet us in a death so noble.
