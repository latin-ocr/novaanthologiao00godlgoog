ANTHOLOGIA

Or sight of vernal bloom‚ or summer’s rose,
Or flooks, or herde,¹ or human face divine;
But cloud instead, and everdumg dark
Surrounde me, from the oheerful ways of men
Out off, and for the book of knowledge fair,
Prosented with a universal blank

Of Nature’e works 1ο me expung’d end ras’d,

And wiedom et one entrance quite shut out.

Thou, as a gallnnt berk from Albion’s coast

(The etorme all wenthered and the ocean orost)
Shoote into port at some well-havened isle,

Where spioes 1118111118 end brighter seasons emile;
There sits quiescent on the floods that show

Her beauteoue form reflected oleer below,

While 1118 impregneted with incense play

Around her, fanning light her streamere gay3

So thou, with 88118, how ewift! hest reached the shore,
Where tempests never beat nor billows mar,

And thy loved consort on the dangerous tide

Of life long since has anchored by thy side.

But me, soarce hoping to attain thet 1881,

Alweye from port withheld‚ always distressed--

Me howling blasts drive devious, tempest-tossed,
Sails ripped, seems opening wide, and compaes lost,
And day by day some ourrent’s thwarting force
Sets me more distant from a prosperoue course.

-Yet, oh! the thought that thou ert saie and he!-
That thought is joy, errive what may to me.

OOWPER.
