Come down, 0 Meid from yonder mountain height:
What pleeeure lives in height? (the ehepherd eeng)
In height end oold, the splendour of the hille?
But oeeee to move eo near the herveus, end eeeee
'Po glide a euubeem by the blested pino,
'I'o eit a ster upon the eperkling spire:
And oome, for Leve is of the velley, come,
For Love is of the velley‚ oome thou down
And find him; by the happy threehold he,
Or hand in houd with Plenty iu the maize,
Or red with epirted purple of the vate,
ι Or foxlike in the vine ; nor cares to welk

With Deeth end Morning on the silver horne:
N or wilt thou enare him in the white ravim,

Nor find him dropped upon the firths oi ioe,
'Phet huddling slent in furrow-cloven felle
'Po roll the torrent out of duelry doore:

But follow: let the torrent danoe thee down
'I'o find him in the velley: let the wild
Lean-headed eeglee yelp alone, end leave
'Phe monstrous ledges there to slope end epill
'I'heir thousand wreethee oi dangling water-smolre,
That like a broken purpose waste in air:

So waste not thou: but oome; for ell the vele
Aweite thee: azure pillere oi the heerth
Ariee to thee: and ohildren oell, end 1
Thy ehepherd pipe, end sweet is every sound:
