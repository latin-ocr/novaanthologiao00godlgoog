Q. Mar. 0! let me entreat thee, oense! Give me
thy hund,

That I may dew it with my mournful teure3
Nor let the rein of heaven wet this ploce,
To wueh away my woeful monumento
01 could thie kiss be printed in thy hand,
Thut thou mightet think upon these by the seul,
Through whom a thousand eighe are brenth’d for thee.
So, get thee gone, that I may know my grief3
”Pis but surmis’d whilee thou ert standing by,
As one that eurfeits thinking on a want.
I will repeel thee, or, be well aesur’d, Ι
Adventure to be bnuished myeelf3
And baniehed I am, ii hut from thee.
&03 epeuk not to me; even now be gone.
ΟΣ go not yet. Even thus two friends oondemn’d
Embraee and hies, und take ten thousand lemen,
Loather a hundred times to part than die.
Yet now farew0113 and forewell life with thee!

Sus. Thus ie poor Suffolk ten times baniehed, ,
Once by the king, and three times thrioe by thee.
'Tie not the lund I oure for, wert thou thenoe3
A wilderneee ie populous enough,
So Suffolk hnd thy heavenly company:
For where thou art, there ie the world iteelf,
With every several pleasure in the world,
And where thou art not, desolation.
I oen no more: live thou to joy thy life3
Myeelf to joy in nought but thet thou liv’ t.
