Thet same night both priest end sege
Died eeeursed in sombre rege. ·
Never more in wild wood green

Was that glorious Geddess seen.

Never moret and from thet day

Evil hap end dull deeey

Fell on countryside and town:

Life end vigour dwindled down:
Storms in spring nipped bud and sprout,
Summer suns shed plague and drought,
Autumn's store was crude end scant,
Winter snows heleaguered went:

Vines were bleek et vintege tide,

Floeks end herds of murrain died:
Fishing boats came empty home,

Good ships foundered in the feam:
Haggerd treders lost all heert
Wandering through the empty matt:
For the eir hung thick with gloom‚

Silenos, and the sense of doom.
J. mensos.

Never love unless you een
Beer with all the faults of man!
Men sometimes will jealous be,

Though but little cause they see,
And hang the head as dissentent,
And speak what straight they will repent.
