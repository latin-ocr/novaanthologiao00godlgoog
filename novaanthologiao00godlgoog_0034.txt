How happy is he born ond taught
Thct serveth not onother's will;

Whoee crmour is his honest thought,
And simple truth his utmost skil1;

Whose passione not his masters cre3
Whose soul is still prepared for death,
Untied unto the world by care
Of public fame or private breath;

Who envies none that chance doth raiee,

Nor vice; who never understood
How dcepest wounds ore given by praise3

Nor rulee of state, but rules of good;

Who heth his life from rumoure freed ;

Whose conscience is his strong retreat;
Whose state con neither flatterers foed,
Nor ruin make oppressore great ;

Who God doth late and early pray
More of his grace then gifte to lend;

And entertains the harmlese day
With a religioue book or friend.

This man is freed from servile bande
Of hope to rise or fear to fall:
Lord of himself, though not 'of lande,
And, having nothing, yet hath all.
