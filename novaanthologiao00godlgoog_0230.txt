CXXXVII

Bul, children, al midnighl,

When solt lhe winde blow,
When clear falls the moonlighl,
When spring-tides are 1011;

When sweet airs come seaward
From heaths started wilh breem,
And high rocks 1111011 mildly

On lhe blanched sends a gloom3
Up the still, glistoning beaehes,
Up 1110 oreeks we will hie,

Over banks of bright seaweed
The ebhtide leaves dry.

We will gaze, from the send-hille,
Α1 the 1111110, sleeping town;

Al the ohuroh 0111110 hill-side-
And then eome baok down.
Singing: ‘There dwells a loved one,
Bul oruel is she!

She 1011 lonely for ever

The kings of lhe sea?

CXXXVIII

Unlrnown thou art3 yet thy fierce vaunl is vain.

Thou dost 1101 slay me, proud and boastful man.
No! Rustum slays me, and this filial hearl.

For were 1 malohed with len such men as thou,
And I were he who till to-day I was

They should be lying here, I standing thero.
