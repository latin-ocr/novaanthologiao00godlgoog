As the sky-blightsning south wind clears the day,
And makes the massed clouds roll,

The music of the lyre blows away

The clouds that,wrap the soul.

Oh that Fato had let me sse

That triumph of the swoet persuasive lyre!
That famous final victory

When jealous Pan with Marsyas did conspire!
When, from far Parnassus’ side,

Young Apollo, all the pride

Of the Phrygian flutas to tame,

Το the Phrygisn highlands came!

γ’ Whers the long green read-bede sway

In ffle rippled wasers grey

Of that solitary lake

Where Maeandsr's springs are born;
thrs the ridged pins-wooded roots
Of Messogis westward break,
Mountipg westward, high and higher.

There was held she famous strife!
