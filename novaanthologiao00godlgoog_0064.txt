Still green with boys each ancient Alter stands,

Above the reach of sacrilegioue hands;

Securo from flames, from Envy’e fiercer ruge,
Destructive War, and all-involving Age.

See, from each clima the learn'd their incense bring!
Hear, in all tongues consenting Paeane ring!

In praise so just let ev’ry voice be join'd,

And ffll the gen’ral chorus of mankind

Heil, Barda triumphanti born in happier days;
Immortalheirs of universal praieel ’

Whose honours with increaeing eges grow,

Aa streame roll down, enlarging ae they flow;
Natione unborn your mighty names shall sound,
And worlds applaud that must not yet be foundl
Oh may some spark of your celestial fire,

The lest, the meanest of your sons inspiro,

(That on weak winge, from far, purauee your fiighte3
Glowe while he reade, but trembles as he writes}

ro teaoh vain Wits a science little known,

'P’ admire superior sense, and doubt their ownl
Poro.

How cen he let off hie own profession ‘i Will that trucu-
lent and uneparing monster who attacks the nobility, the
olwgy, the army, and the ladiee, indiscriminately, hesitato
when the turn comes to &perper his own fieeh and blood?

My dean and excellent querist, whom does the School-
master flog so resolutely as his own son? Didn’t Brutus
chop his offspring'e head off? You have a very bed
