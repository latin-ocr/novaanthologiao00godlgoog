The building was 1 speoious theatro
Half-round, on two main pillars vaulted high,
With seete where 111 the lorde, end 01011 degree
Of sort, might sitin order to behold;
The other eide 1111 open, where tho throng
On benks and 1111101111 under sky might stend3
I among these 11001 obseurely stood.
The 10101 111 noon grew high, and sacrifice
Had fill'd their 1101111 with mirth, high eheer, and wine,
When to their eports they tum'd. Immediately
Was Samson ee 1 publio servant brought,
In their 11110 livery 011(1; before him pipes
And timbrele, on each side went ermed guards,
Both horse and 1001, before him 111 behind,
Arehere and elingere, cataphraote and epeers.
At eight of him the people with 1011011
Rifted the 111, olamouring their god with praise, .
Who hed mede their dreadtul enemy their thrall.
He, patient, but undaunted, where they led him,
Came 10 the pleoe3 and what was 001 before him,
Whioh without help 01 eye might be assay'd,
To 110110, pull, drew, 01 break, he still perform'd
All with incredible, stupendious 10100,
None dering to appear antagonist.
