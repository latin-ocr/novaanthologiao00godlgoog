ΟΞ how muoh more doth beenty beauteous seem

By that sweet ornament which truth deth give!

Tho rose looks fair, but fairer we it deem

For that sweet odour which doth in it live. .

The oenkenblooms heve full ao deep a dyo

As the perfumod tincture of the roseo, .

Hang on such thorno, and play os wantonly

When summer’s breeth their mosked buds dieolososz

But, for their vhtue only is their show,

They live unwoo'd, end unrespeoted fade;

Die to themselveo Sweet roseo do not so;

Of their eweet deaths are eweetest odours mede:
And eo of you, beauteous and lovely youth,
When thot shall fade, my verse distils your t th.

The rain had fallen, the Poet arose,
He poss'd by the town and out of the street,
A light wind blew from the getes of the sun,
And wavos of shedow went over tho wheet‚
And he sat him down in a lonely placo,
And chented a melody loud and sweet‚
Thet made the wild·swan pause in hor oloud,
And the lerk drop down at his feet.
The swellow stopt as he hunted the bee,
The snake slipt under a sprey,
The wild hawk stood with the down on his beak,
And stered, with his foot on the prey‚
And the nightingale thought, ‘ Ι have sung many songn,
But never a one eo gay,
For he eings of what the world will be
When the years have died away?
