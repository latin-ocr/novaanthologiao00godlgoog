ANTHOLOGIA

mu
Woods, that weve o’er Delphi's steep,
Isles‚ that erown th’ Egaeen deep,
Fields, that eool Ilissus leves,
Or where Maeander's ember waves
In lingering Lab'n‘nths ereep,
How do your tuneful Eehoes languish, ’
Mute, but to the voice of Anguish‘?
Where each old poetic Mountain
Inspiration breeth’d eround:
Ev'ry shade end hellow’d Fountain
Murmur’d deep a solemn sound:
Til] the sed Nine‚ in Greeee’s evil honr,
Left their Parnassus for the Latian pleins.
Alike they seorn the pomp of tyrent Power,
And eoward Viee, 'theb revels in her chains.
When Latium hed her lofty spirit lost,

They sought, oh Albion! next thy sea-eneireled coest.
