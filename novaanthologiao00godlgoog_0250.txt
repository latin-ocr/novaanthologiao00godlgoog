ANTHOLOGIA

01,

Manuel, Ido not shed a tear
Our parting 1ο delay3

I dare noi lisien 1ο my fear,
I dare not bid thee stay.

'I'he heari may shrink‚ the spirit fail,
But Spaniards musi be free!

And pride and duty shall prevail
0'er all my love for thee.

Then go, and round that gallant head,
Like berners in the eir,

Shall 11001 full many a daring hope
And many a tendor prayer.

Should freedom perieh—et thy death
’Twere madness 10 repine;

And I should every feeling lose
Excepi the wish for mine.

But if the desiiny of Spain
Be onee again 10 rise!

Ο grant me, Heaveni 10 read the tale
In Manuel's joysul eyes.
