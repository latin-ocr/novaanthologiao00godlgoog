Waked by the circling hours‚ with rosy hand
Unbarred the gates of light. There is a eave
Within the mount of eod, fast by his throne,
Where light and darkness in perpetual round
Lodge and dislodge by turns, which makes through

Heaven
Grateful vicissitude, like day and night;
Light issues forth, and at the other door
Obsequious darkness enters, till her hour
To veil the heaven, though darkness there might well
Seem tthight here; and now went forth the mom,
Such asin highest Heaven, arr'ayed in gold
Empyrea13 from before her vanished night,
Shot through with orient beams; when all the plain,
Covered with thick embattled squadrons bright,
Chariots, and flaming arms, and fiery steeds,
Refleeting blane on blare, first met his view:
War he perceived, war in procinct; and found
Already known what he for news had thought
To have reported: gladly then he mixed
Among those friendly powers, who him received
With joy and acclamations loud, that one,
That ot so many myriads fallen yet one
Returned not lost. On to the sacred hill
They led him high applauded, and present
Before the seat supreme; from whence a voice,
From 'midst a golden cloud, thus mild was heard.
