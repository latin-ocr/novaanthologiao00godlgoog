LXVI

All are not just, because they do no wrong,

But he, who will not wrong me when he may,
He is the truly just. I praise not them,

Who in their petty dealings pilfer n0t;

But him, whose conscience spurns a secret fraud,
When he might plunder and deiy surprise:

His be the praise, who looking down with scorn
On the false judgement of the partial herd,
Consults his own clear heart, and boldly dares
Το be, not to be thought, an honest man.

CUNBEBLAND.

LXVII

Now fades the last long strealr oi snow,
Now burgeons every meze of quick
About the flowering equares, and thick

By ashen roots the violets blow.

Now rings the woodland loud and long,
The distance takes a lovelier hue,
And drown’d in yonder living blue

The lark becomes a sightless song.

Now dance the lights on lawn and lea,
The fiocks are whiter down the vale,
And milkier every milky sail

On winding stream or dietant sea3

Where now the seamew pipes, or dives

In yonder greening gleam, and fly

The happy birds, that change their sky
To build and br00d3 that live their lives

From land to land3 and in my breast
Spring wakens too; and my regret

Bccomee an April violet,
And buds and blossoms like the rest. connisos.
