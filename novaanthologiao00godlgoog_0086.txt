B. Tho firo takes.

Ο. It does so,
But no flamo risos. Ooaso your iretful prayers‚
Your whinings, and your tamo petitione.
' Tho gods love oourago armori with confidenoe,
And prayers fit to pull thom down3 woak terro
And troubled boario, the dull iwins of oold spirito,
They sii and smile ai Heor how Ι salute ’em.
Divino Andate, thou who hold’st tho roins
Of furious battles und disorderod war,
And proudly roll’st thy swarty charioowheels
Ovor tho heaps of wounds and caroasos, ’
Sailing through sous of blood; thou sure-steolod storn-

noos,

Givo us this day good bearis, good onomieu
Good blows o' both sides, wounds that four or ssight
Can claim no share in: sieol us both with angers
And warliko oxeouiions fit thy viowing;
Lot Romo put on herbosi strength, ond thy Britain,
Thy little Britain, but as great in fortune,
Meet hor as strong os she, as proud‚ as during!
And then look on, thou red-oyed god! who does best,

Roward with honour; who despair makes fly,

Unarm for over, and brand with infamyl
