CLXXI

But oh, chat deep romantio ohasm which slanted
Down the green hill athwart a cedam cover!

A savage place, as holy and enchanted

As e’er beneath a waning moon was haunted

By woman wailing for her demon lover.

And from this chasm, with cesseless turmoil seeffiing,
As if this earth in fast thick pants were breathing‚
A mighty fountain momently was forced:

Amid whose swift‚ half-intermisceo burst

Huge fragments vaulted like rebounding hail,

Or chaffy grain bensath dhe thrcsher’s flail;

And ’mid these dancing rocks at once and ever
It flung up momently the sacred river.

Five miles meandering with a mazy motion
Throdgh wood and dale the sacred river ran,

Thon reached the caverns measureless to man,
And sank intumult to a lifeless ocean:
And ’mid this tumult Kubla heard from far
Ancestral voices prophesying war.
