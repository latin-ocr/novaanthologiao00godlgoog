Life is a oity with many a street:
Death ie the marhot where all men meet:

If life were a thing which gold could buy,
The poor could not live and the rich would 1101 die.

And Phaethon they found, or what seem’d ho,

Low lying in the mods, a oharr’d blaoh mese,
Furrow’d with trenchent fire from head 10 1001.
Whom yet with mverenh hands they listed up
And bare him 10 the bank, and wash'd the limbs
In vein ; end, for 1110 11111111 shrede elinging 10 him,
Robed the oold form in 1011110111 shining white.
Then 011 ohe river-merge they seoop’d a greve
And laid him in 1110 denk 0111111 far oport,

Near 10 none else3 forno 1110 dead are leid
Whom Zeus, 1110 Thunderer, heth 0111 off by fire.
And 0111110 tomb thoy pour’d forth wine and 011.
Nor fail'd they 10 record in distich due

How from a hingly venture kingly fall

Resulted, and e higher then humen fame.
