From tho foresto and highlands
Wo nomo, wo nomo:
l'rom the river-girl islanda, '
Whoro loud wavos aro dumb
Listening to my swoel pipingn
Tho wind in the reods and rushes,
Tho boos on the bolls ol thymo,
'l'ho birds on the myrtle bushes,
The 818818 above in the limo,
And the lizards below in tho grass,
Wore 88 silent as over old Tmolus was,
hisloning 1ο my swool pipings.

Liquid Peneus was flowing,

And all dark 'Pompo lay
In Polion’s shodow, outgrowing

Tho light of the dying day,

Spoeded with my sweot pipings.

Tho Sileni ond Silvans and Fauno,

And the Nymphs of tho woodo and wallon,
To the edge of tho moisl ridor-lawns,

And the brink of tho dewy caves,-
And all that then did attend and follow,

Wero silent with love: as you now, Apollo,
With onvy of my sweet pipingsl

I sang of tho danoing staro,
I sang of tho daedal Enrth,

And of Heovon, and tho Gianl Wars,
And Love, and Doath, ond Birth:
