ANTHOLOGIA

Men that hutone Saint adore,

Make a show of love to more;

Beauty must be soor-ned in none,
Though but truly served in one:

For what is courtship but disguise‘?
'Irus hearts may have dissembling eyes.

Men, when their affairs require,

Must awhile themselves retiret
Sometimes hunt and sometimes hawk,
And not ever sit and talk:

If these and such-like you can bear,

Thon like and love, and never fearl
Τ. camon.

LIII

The world is too much wlth us; late and soon
Gotting and sponding, we lay waste our powers;
Little we see in Nature that is ours:
We have given our hearts away, a sordid boon!
The sea that hares her bosom to the moon,
The winde that will be howlmg at all hours
And are upgathered now like sloeping fiowors-
For this, for everything‚ we are out of tune:
’ It moves us not. Great Godl I’d rather be
Α Pagan, suckled in a oreed outworn:
So might I, standing on this pleasant lea,
Have glimpses that would make me less forlorn,
Have sight of Proteus rising from the sea,

Or hear old Triton blow his wreathed horn!
wonnswon'ffl.
