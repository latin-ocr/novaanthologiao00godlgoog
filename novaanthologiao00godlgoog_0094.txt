My great love
Sprang up redoubled, and east out my hate
And spumed all thought of feer; and down the stuir
I hurried, and upon tho bleeding form
Ι threw myeelf, and raised his head, end elasped
His body to mino, end kiesed him on the lips,
And in his dying ear confessed my wrong,
And saw the horror in his dying eyes,
And knew that Ι was demned. And when he breathed

His laet pure breeth, Irose and elowly spoke—

Turned to a Fury now by love end pein-

To the old man who knelt, while all the throng
Oould hear my soeret: ‘See thou feel, 1 em

The murdereee of thy son, end thou my dupe,

Thou and thy gods. See, he was innoeent ;

I murdered him for love. Ι seem ye all,

Theo and thy gods together, who are deoeived

By a woman's lying tongue! Oh, doting feel,

To hate thy own! And ye, false powers, which punish
The innocent, and let the guilty soul

Escepe unseethed, I hate ye ull—I curse,
1 loethe you 1’
