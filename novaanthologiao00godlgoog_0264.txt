Fer. This is strange: your father's' in some passion

'lhst works him strongly.
Mira. Never till this day
Suw I him toueh’d with snger so distemper’d.
Pro. You do look, my son, in e moved sort,
As if you were dismay'd: be oheerful, sir:
Our revels now ere ended. These our solers,
As I forelold you, were ull spirits and
Are melied into eir, into thin eir:
And, like the baseless fabrio of this vision,
The cloud-eapp’d towers, the gorgeous peleees,
The solemn temples‚ the green globo itself,
Yee, ull whieh ieiunarit, shall dissolve
And, like this insubstantial pegeani faded,
Leave not e raek behind. We ere such stuff
As dreams are made on, and our little life

Is ronnded with a sleep.
