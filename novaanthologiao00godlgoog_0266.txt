'l'he Danube to the Severo gave
The darkon'd heart that beat no more:
They laid him by the pleasant shore,
And in the hearing of the wave.

There twice a day the Severn' fills;
'Phe salt sea-water passos by,

And hushes half the babbling Wye,
And makes a silence in the hills.

The Wye is hush'd nor moved along,
And hush’d my deepest grief of all,
When fill’d with tears that cannot fall,

, Ι brim with sorrow drowning song.

The tide flows down, the wave again
Is vocal in its wooded walls3

My deeper anguish also falls, '
And I ean spealr a little then.

CLXII

The Autumn skies are flushed with gold,
And fair and bright the rivers run;

These are but streams of winter oold,
And painted mists that quenoh the sun.

In seoret boughs no sweet birds sing,
In secret boughs no bird ean shroud3

These are but leaves that take to wing
And wintry winda that pipo so loud.

’ris not trees’ shade, but oloudy glooms
That on the oheerless valleys fall;
The flowers are in their grassy tombs,
And tears of dew are on them all
