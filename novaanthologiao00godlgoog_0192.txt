Mes ehere amis, quand je mourrai,
Plentez un saule eu eimetiere:

J 'aime son feuillege eplore,

Le peleur m'en est douee et chere,
Et eon ombre eera legere

A le terre eu je dormirai.

Ι dream'd there would be Spring no more,
Thai Nature’s ancient power wee lost:

The streete were blaek with smoke end fresi,
They chatter’d trifles ei the door:

Iwender’d from the noisy town,
1 found e wood with thorny boughs:

Itook the thorneie bind my brows,
Iwore them like a eivie erown:

I mei with eeoffe I mei with seorns
From youth and babe end heary hairs:
They eall'd me in ihe publie equares
The feel that weers a erown of thome:

· They eall’d me feel, they cell'd me child:

1 found en angel of the night3
- The voice was low, the look was bright3
He look'd upon my erown and smiled:

He reaeh’d ihe glory ofa hand,
That seem'd to toueh it inte leaf:
The voice was noi the voiee of grief,
The words were hard io understand.
