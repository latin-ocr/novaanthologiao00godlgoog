Then I’ll look up;
My fault ie past But, 01 what form of prayer
Can serve my turn? ‘Forgive me my foul murder?’
That cannot be; since Ι am still poaeeee’d
0f those effecte for which I did the murder,
My crown, mine own ambiti0n‚ and my queen.
May one be pardon’d and retain the essehoc?

In the corrupted currente of this world

Offence's gilded hand may shove by justice,
And oft 'tis seen the wicked prize itself

Buye out the law; but ’tis not so above;

There is no ahuffling, there the action lies

In his true nature, and we ouraelves compell’d
Even to the teeth and forehead of our faults

Το give in evidence. What then? What rests?
Try what repentance can: what can it not?
Yet what canit, when one can not repent?

0 wretched atate! Ο bosom black as death!

O limed seul, that struggling to be free

Art more engaged! Help, angela! make asaay;
B0w‚ stubborn huces, and heart with stringe of steel
Be eoft 'ae sinews of the new-bom babe ;

All may be well.
