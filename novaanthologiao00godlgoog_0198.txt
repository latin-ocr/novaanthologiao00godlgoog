Now on the summit of Love’s lopmost peak

Kiss we und pert3 no further 0011 we go:

And better (1001111100 we from high 10 low
should dwindle 01 decline from strong 1ο week.
We have found 011, there is no more 10 00011 ;
All heve we proved, no more is there 10 know3 ’
And Time could only luterus 10 eke

0ut rapture’s warmth with eustom'e after-glou.
We cannot keep 01 such 0 height ae this;

And even straining seule like oure inhele

But onee in 1110 so rerefied 0 111100.

what if we lingered 1111 love’s breelh should 10111
Heaven 01 my 0011111 0110 more 0010011οΙ lise,
Then down by separate pathweye 10 the vale.

CXIV

net golden youth bewail the friend, the wife,
For ever gone;

He thinks 01 that long welk thro' desert 1110
without 1110 one.

The eilver year should 0000010 mourn and sigh-
Not long 10 wait-

So close 010 we, deer Mery, you end Ι,
To 11101 dim gete.

Teke, read! and be 1110 1011110 your poet makes
Or many 01 few,

He rests 00110111, 11 his young musio wakes,
A wish in you

To change our dark Queenoily, 011 her 1001111
01 eound end emoke, '

For his clear heaven, and these few lanes of olm

And whispering oak

TENNYSON.
