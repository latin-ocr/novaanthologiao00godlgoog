Sleep, angry beauty, sleep and fear not me:

For who a sleeping lion darae provoke‘?

It shall suffice me here to sit and eee

'l'hough guilty much 61 wrong done to my love:
And in her elumber, see! 6116 oloseeyed weeps!

Plead‚ sleep, my cause, and make her 6611 like thee,

That 6116 111 peace may wake and pity me!
