And night came down over the solemn waste
And the two gezing hoste and that sole pair
And darkened all, and a eeld fog with night
Crept from the Oxus, Soon a hum arose
As ef a great assembly leosed, and fires
Began to twinkle through the sog, for now
Both armies moved to camp and took their meal;
The Persians took it on the open sande
Seuthward: the Tenere by the river merge,
And Rustum and hie son were left alone.

But the mejestie river floated on
0ut of the mist and hum of that low land
Inte the frosty sterlight‚ and there mered
Rejoicing through tho hushed Ohoroemian waste
Under the solitary moon. He flowed
Right for the polar star past Orgunje
Brimming and bright and large. Then sande begin
To hem his watery march, end dam his streame,
And eplit his currente, that for many a league
The ehorn and parcelled Oxus straine along
Through bede of send and matted ruehy isles,
Oxus forgething the bright speed he had
In hie high mountain eradle in Pamire,
A foiled circuibous wanderer 3 till at last
'Phe longed·for dash of weves ie heard, end wide
His luminous home of wetere opens bright
And tranquil, from whose fioor the new-bathed stare
Emerge and shine upon the Arel sea.
