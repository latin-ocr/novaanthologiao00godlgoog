0 lady, leave thy silken thread
And fiowery lapeslri03

'Phere’s living rosea on lhe burh,
And bloeaoma on the tree:

Sloop where thou will, thy careleas hand
Some random bud will meet ;

Thou canat nol breed, bul lhou wila find
'Phe daiay at thy feel.

’ris like the birlhday of the world,
When earth was born in bloom3
The light ia made of many dyas,

'Phe airis all perfume;

There'e erimeon buda, and while and blue-
The very rainbow showera

Have turn'd lo blossoms where lhey fell,
And sown the earth with flowere.

There's fairy tulips in the east,
The gardan of the eun 3

The very streame refiert the haee,
And blosaome aa they run:

While Morn opes like a erimeon rose,
still wel with pearly ehowers3

Then, lady, leave the silken thread
Thou twinesl into fiowers!
