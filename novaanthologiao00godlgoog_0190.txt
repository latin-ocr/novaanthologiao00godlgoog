Ο Mort, vieux capitaine, il est temps, levons l’anorel
Oe pays nous ennnie, o Mortl Appareillonsl
Si le ciel et la 10010001 noirs comme de l'encre,
Nos coeurs que tu connais sont remplis 10 rayons!
Verso-nous ton poison, pour qu’il nous reconforte!
Nous voulons, tant ce feu nous brule le cerveau,
Plonger au fond du gouffre, Enfer ou Ciel, qu’importe?

Au fond de l’Inoonnu pour trouver du 00000001
caucanam.

We must look the possibility 01 failure firmly in the

face, and consider well that the Power we attack is great
and the intelligence which guides it vigemus, that the
contest is begun less in regard to the probability 01
success than to the certainty that without it destruction
is 001 10 be avoided, and that we do our duty better
by our own age and the next and by the honour 01 the
king and 001100 10 falling with arms in our hands, than
in patiently suffering ourselves to be iettered and held
in chains. We must make ourselves familiar with the
thought 01 every kind of sacrifice and of death if we
would troad the path now proposed. Thus prepared
internally and favoured by circumstances, let us begin 10
God’s name and remember that by courage and fortitude
great 0010 11ον0 been reached with small means. Only
we must be rid of all languid wretched creatures that are
insensible 10 noble feelings and incapable of any kind
of devotion 001 sacrifice, people who mar 001 spoil
everything 001 think of nothing but the quiet enjoyment

01 their miserable existence.
