v111

When tha man wante waight the woman takes it up,
And topples down the aoalee3 but this ia fixed
Aa are the roots of earth and base of all:

Man for the field and woman for the hoarth:
Man for the sword 'and for the needle she:

Man with tha head, and woman with tha heart:
Manto command and woman to obey:

All else confusion Look youl tha gray mam
Ie ill to live with, when her whinny shrilla
From tile to aeullary‚ and her small goodman
Shrinke in his arm-chain while the fires of Hell

Mix with his hearth: but you-she's yet a ooltr-

Take‚ baeak her: strongly groom'd and atraitly ourb'd
She might not rank with those detestable
That let the bantling scald at home, and brawl

Their rights or wrongs like poeno-bs in the street.
