But that belovod name unnerved my arm-

That name, and something, I confess-in thee
Which troubles all my beart, and made my shield
Fall; and thy spear transfixed an unarmed foe.
And now thou boastest‚ and insult'st my fate.
But hear thou this, fieres man; tremble to hear!
The mighty Rustum shall avenge my death!

My father, whom Ι seek through all the world,

. He shall avonge my death, and punish thee.

Α time there was, ere England's griefs began,
When every rood 01 ground maintained its man.
For him light labour spread her wholesome storo,
Just gave what life required, but gave 110 more.
His best companions innoeenoe and health

And his best riohos ignoranos of wealth.

But times are altered, trade’s unfeeling train
Usurp the land, and dispossess the swain.

Along the lawn where soattered hamlets rose,
Unwisldy wealth and oumbrous pomp repose3
And every want to opulenoe allied,

And every paug that folly pays to pride.

These gentle hours that plenty bade to bloom,
These oalm desires that asked but little 100111,
These healthful sports that graoed the peaoeful soene,
Lived in eaoh look, and brightened all the green,
These far departing seek a kinder shore,

And rural' mirth and manners are no more.
