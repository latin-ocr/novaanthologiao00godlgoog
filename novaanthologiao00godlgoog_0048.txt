Tell me, ye studione, who pretend to see

Far into nature’e boeom, whenee the beo

Wae first inform’d her venturoue flight to eteer
Through traehleee pathe and an abyee of air:
Whenee she evoide the elimy marah and knows

The fertile hilis, where eweeter herbage grows
And bonag-making flowere their opening buds diselose:
How from the thieken'd mist and setting eun
Finde ehe the labour of her day is done?

Who taught her against winde and rains to strive,
To bring her burden to the eertein hive, Ι

And through the liquid fielde again to pesa,
Duteoue end heerkening to the sounding bross?
And, 0 thou sluggerd, tell me why the ant,
'Midet summer’s plenty, thinks of winter’s want,
By eonetant journeya eareful to prepare

Her stores ; and bringing home the eorny ear,

By what instruction does ehe bite the grain,

Leet, hid in earth and taking root again,

It might elude the feresight of her aare?

Distinet in all the inseet’e deeds appear

'Phe merke of thought, eontrivanee, hope end fear.
Palen.

Yes‚ 'tie the eternel law thet where guilt is

Sorrow shall answer it: and thou haet not
A poor man'e privilege to beer aione,

Or in the narrow eirele of hie kinemen,
The penelties of evil, for in thine

A nation'e fate lies eireled. King Adrastus!
