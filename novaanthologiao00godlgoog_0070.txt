In all my wendorings round this world oi cere,
In all my griefs-end God has given my share-
Ι still hed hopes, my latest hours to crown,
Amidet these humble bowere to lay me down;
'ro husband out life’e taper at the close,

And keep the fleme from wanting by reposo.

Ι still hed hopeS, for pride attendo us still,
Amidst the sweine to show my book-learn’d skill,
Around my fire an evening group to drcw,

And tell ofoll Ι felt, and cll I sew;

And, as the here, whom hounde and horne pursue,
Pente to the place from whence ct firnt she flew,
Ι still had hopes, my long vexatione pese’d,

Here to return-end die 'et home ct laet

0 blest retirement, friend to life’e decline,
Retrecte from care, thet never must be mine,
How happy he who crowns in shades like these
A youth of lebour with en age oi ecso;

Who quite a world where strong temptatione try,
And, since 'tie hard to combet, learns to fiyl
For him no wretched born to work and weep,
Explore the mine, or tempt the dengeroue deep ;

No curly porter stands in guilty stete

'Po epum imploring femine from the gete3
But on he moves to meet his latter end,
Angels around befriending Virtue's friend;

Bends to the grave with unperceiy'd decey,

While Resignation gently clopes the wey;

And, all hie prospecte brightening to the last,

His Henven commences ere the world be paes’dl
comeum.
