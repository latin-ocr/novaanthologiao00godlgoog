Soon the assembly‚ in a circle ranged,
Stood silent round the shrine: each look was changed
To sudden veneration: women meek
Beckon’d their sons to silence; while each cheek
Of virgin bloom paled gently for slight fear.
Endymion too, without a forest peer,
Stood, wan, and pale, and with an awed face,
Among his brothers cf the mountain chase.
In midst of all, the venerable priest
Eyed them with joy from greatest to the least,
And, efter lifting up his aged hands
Thus spake he: ‘Men of Latmos! shepherd bande!
Whose care it is to guard a thousand fiooks:
Whether descended from beneath the rocks
That overtop your mountains; whether come
From valleys where the pipo ie never dumb;
Or from your ewelling downs‚ where sweet air stirs
Blue hare-bells lightly, and where prickly furze

Buds lavish gold ; cryc, whose precious charge
Nibble their fill at ocesn's very margo,

Whose mellow reeds are touch’d with sounds iorlorn
By the dim echoes cf old Triton's horn:

Mothers and wives! who day by day prepare

The scrip, with needments, for the mountain air ;
And cil ye gentle girls who foster up

Udderless lambe, and in a little cup

Will put choice honey for a favour’d youth:
Yes‚ every one attendi for in good truth

Our vows aru wanting to cur great god Pan.
