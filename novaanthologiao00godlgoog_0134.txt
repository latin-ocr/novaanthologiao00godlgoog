LXVIII

In vaine do men
The heavens of their fortune's fault aoeuse,
Sith they know best what is the best for them:
For they to esch such fortune doe diffuse
As they doe know each ean most aptly use.
For not that which men covet most is best,
Nor that thing worst which men doe most refuse;
But fictae is chae all contented rest

With what they hold; each hnth his fortune in his
breast.

LXIX

Yet not the more

Oease I to wander where the muses haunt
Olear spring, or shady grove, or sunny hill,

emit with the love of sacred song: but chief
Thoe, Sion, and the flowery brooks beneath
Theb wash thy hallow’d feet, end warbling flow,
Nightly I visit: nor sometimes forgeh

Those other two equall’d with me in fate,

So were I equall'd with them in renown
Blind Thamyris and blind Maeoniden,

And Tiresias and Phineus, prophete old.

Thon feed on thoughts, that voluntary move
Harmonious numbers3 as the wakeful bird
Sings dorffling, and in shediest covent hid
Tunes her noetnnal note. Thus with ihe year
Seasons return; but not to me returns

Day, or the sweef approach of ev’n ermom,
