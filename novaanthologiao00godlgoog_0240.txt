Aht little think the gay lieentious proud‚

Whom pleasure, power, and affluenoe surround;
They, who their thoughtlees honre in giddy mirth
And wauton, often eruel, riot waste 3—

Ahi little think they, while they danoe along,

How many feel this very moment death
And all the sad variety of pain3

How many eink in the devouring stood,

Or more devouring fiame; how many bleed
By ehamesnl varianae betwixt man and man 3
How many pine in want and dungeon glooma
Shut from the common air and oommon use
Of their own limbe3 how many drink the oup
Of baleful grief or eat the bitter breed

Of misery3 sore piereed by wintry winde
How many ehrink into the sordid hut

Of oheerless poverty3 how many shake

With all the fioroer tortures of the mind,
Unbounded passion, mednesa guilt, remoree;
How many rnoked with honest passione droop
In deep retired distress; how many stand
Around the death-bed of their dearest friends

And point the panting anguishi
