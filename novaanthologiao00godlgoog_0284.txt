When in the down I sink my head,

Sleep, Death’s tvvm-brother, times my breath3
Sleep‚ Death’s tvvm-brother, knows not Death‚
Nor oen Ι dream of thee es dead:

Ι welk as ere Ι welk’d forlorn,
When all our path was fresh with dew,

And all the bugle breezes blew
Reveielle to the breaking mern.

But what is this? Ι turn about,

Ι find a trouble in thine eye,

Whioh makes me sad Ι know not why,
Nor oen my dream resolve the doubt:

But ere the lark heth left the lea
Ι wake, and I diseern the truth;
It is the trouble of my youth
Thet foolish sleep transfers to thee.
