46 mammeam

Having 1101 within her womb that had 1011 her ill

n .
And cdhde :eldad they came aboard ue, and they fought ue

hand 10 hand,

For a dozen times they came with their pikes and
musqueteera

And a dozen times we shook ’em off as a dog 1101
shakes his ears

When he leaps from the water 10 the land.

And 110 eun went down, and 110 stare came 011 far
over 110 summer sea,

But never a moment eeased the fight of 110 one and
110 fifty-three.

Ship after ahip, the whole night long, their high-built
galleons came,

Ship aster ahip, 110 whole night long, with her 101110
thunder and flame;

Ship after ship, the whole night long, drew back with
her dead and her shame.

For some were sunk and many were shahter’d, and so
could fight us no more—

God of 1011100, was ever a battle like this in 110 world
before?

For he said ι11010001 fight 0111’

Tho’ hia veesel was all but a wreek;

And 11 chaneed 1101, when half of the short summer
night was gene,

With a grisly wound 1010 drest he had left the deek,

But a 101101 struck him that was dressing 11 suddenly
dead,

And himself he was wounded again in 110 side and
110 head,

And he said ‘Fight on! fight on 1’

mammon.
