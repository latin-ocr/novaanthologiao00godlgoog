This was the old men’s favourite tole, end he loved to
repeat it

When his neighbours complained that any injustiee
was donc them.

‘Once in an ancient city, whose name I no longer
remember‚

Raised aloft on c column, a brczen statuo of Justice

Stood in the public square, upholding the scales in its
left hand,

And in its rights sword‚ cs an emblem that justice
presided

Over the laws 01 the land, and the hearts and homes
01 the people.

Even the birds had built their nests in the scales 01
the balance,

Having no fear 01 the swerd that flashed in the sun·
shine above them.

But in the course 01 time the laws of the land were
corrupted3

Might took the place of right, and the weak were
oppressed, and the mighty

Ruled wilh an iren rod. Thon it chanced in a noble κ
man’s pnlace

That a necklace 01 pearls was lost, and ere long a
suspicion .

Fell on an orphen girl who lived as maid in the household.

She, after form 01 trial condemned to die on the
scaffold, .

Patiently met her doom ct the 1001 01 the statue 01
Justice.

As 10 her Father in heaven her innocent spirit aseended,

Lol 0'er the citya tempest rose 3 and the bolte 01 the

thunder
