Ο lyrie love, half-angel and half-bird
And all a wonder and a wild desire,-
Boldeat ef hearts that ever braved the sun,
Took sanctuary within the holier blue,
And sang a kindred soul out to hie face,—
Yet human at the red-ripe of the heart-
When the first summoue from the darkling earth
Reaehed thee amid thy chambere, blanched their blue,
And bared them of their glory-to drop down,
Το toil for man, to suffer or to die,-
Thie ie the same voice: ean thy seul know change?
Hail then, and hearken from the realme of help!
Never may I eommenee my song, my due
To God who best taught song by gift of thee,
Except with bent head and beeeeahing hand—
That still, despite tho' distance and the dark,
What was, again may be: some interchange
Of grace, some splendour onae thy very thought,
Some benedietion anciently thy emila: ¹
-Never eonelude, but raising hand and head
Thither where eyes, that cannot reaeh, yet yearn
For all hope, all sustainment, all reward,
Their utmost, up and on,-a0 bleesing back
In those thy reelme of help, that heaven thy home,
Some whiteness which, I judge, thy face makes proud,

Some wannees where, I think, thy foot may fall!
BROWNING.
