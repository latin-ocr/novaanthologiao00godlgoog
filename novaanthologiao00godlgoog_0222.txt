Oh,
My God! Oen it be possible I have
'lo die so suddenly? so young to go

Under the obscure, eold, rotting, wormy ground?

'l‘o be neiled down into e nerrow pleoe;

To see no more sweot sunshine; hearne more

Blitho voice of living thing; muse not again

Upon familiar thoughts-sed, yet thus lost!

How fearfull To be nothing! or to be-

What? Or where em I? Let me not go med!
Sweel Heaven, forgive week thoughts l If there should be
No God, no heaven, no earth, in the void world,

¹ The wide, grey, lampless, deep, unpeopled world!

If all things then should be my father’s spirit,

His eye, his voice, his touch, surrounding me, ,
The atmosphere and breath of my dead life!

If sometimes, es a shepe more like himself,

Even the form which tortured me on earth,

Masked in grey heire and wrinkles, he should come,
And wind me in his hellish arms, eud fix

His eyes on mino, end drag me down, down, down!
For was he not alone omnipotent

On earth, and ever present? Even though dead
Does not his spirit live in all that breethe,

And work for me end mine still the samo ruin,

Seorn, pain, despair?
SRELLEY.
