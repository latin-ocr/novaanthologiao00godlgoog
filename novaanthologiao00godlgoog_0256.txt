Α strait long entry 10 the temple led,
Blind with high walls, and horror over head ;
Thence issued such a blast, and hollow roar,
As threatened from the hinge to heare the door.
The gate was adamant; eternal frame
Which, hewed by Mars himself, from Indian quarries
eame,
The labour 016 God3 and all along
Tough iron platee were elenehed to make it strong.
On the other side there stood Destruetion bare;
Unpuniehed Rapine, and a waste 01 war.
Loud menae-es were heard, and foul disgraee,
And bawling infamy, in language base;
Till sense was lost in sound, and silence fied the place.
The slayer 01 himself yet saw I there,
The gere congealed was clotted in his hair;
With eyes half elosed and gaping mouth he lay,
And grim, as when he breathed his sullen seul away.

DBYDEN.
