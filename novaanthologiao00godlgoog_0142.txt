ANTHOLOGIA

LXXIV

Behold and lislen, while the fair

Breaks in sweel sounds the willing air,
And with her own breath fans the fire
Which her brighl eyes do first inspiro.
What reason can that love control
Which more than one way courls the soul‘?
So when a flash of lightning falls

On our abodes‚ the danger calls

For human aid, which hopes the flame
To conquer, though from heaven it came:
But if the winde with thal conspire‚

Men chive not, bul deploro the fire.

LXXV

Like as the waves make towards the pebbled shore,

So do our minutos hasten to their end; ’

Each changing place with that which goes before,

In sequent toi] all forwerds do coniend.

Nativity‚ once in the main of light,

Orawls to malurily, wherewith being orown’d‚

Orooked eclipses ’gainst his glory fighl,

And Time that gave doth now his gift confound.

Time doth transfix the fiourish set on youlh

And delves the parallels in beauly's brow,

Feeds on the rarities of nature’s irath,

And nothing stands buc for his scythe io mow:
And yet to times in hope my verse shall stand,

Praising thy woilh‚ despite his cruel hand.
