Then saw they how 111010 hove 0 dusky berge,

Bleek 00 0 funeral soarf from 010111 10 stem,

Beneeth them; end deseending they were ware

'Phet all the deoks were dense with stetely forme,
Black-stoled, blech-hooded, like 0 dream-by these
Three Queens with erowne 01 gold: and 110111 1110111 1000
A ery thet shiver’d 10 the tingling 01010,

And, 00 11 were one voice, 011 agony

Ο1101110111011011, like 0 wind 11101 ehrille

All night in 0 0001010011, where no one eomes,

Or heth oome, since the making 01 the world.

Life! I know not what thou 011;
But know that thou and 1 must pert ;

And when or how or where we met,

I own, to me's 0 000101 yet

Life! we've been long together
, Through pleasant end through oloudy weether3
’Tis hard to pant when friends are deer-
Perheps 'twill 0001 0 sigh, 0 tear:
Thon 01001 away—give little werning:

(lhooee thine own time:

Sey 1101 ‘good night‚' but in some brighton olime

Bid me ‘good morning'
