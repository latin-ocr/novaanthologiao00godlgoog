‘what she felt the while,
Must I think?

Love's so different with u's men 1’
He should smile:

‘Dying for my sake-
white and pink!

Oan't we touch these bubblos then
But thoy break?'

Dour, the paug is brief,
Do thy part,

Have thy pleasurel How perplexed
Grows belief!

Was man’s hoart:

Orumble it, and what comos next?
Is it God?

LXI

Of Manners gentle, of Affections mild;

In wit, a Man; Simplicity, a child:

With native Humour bemp’ring virtuous Bago,
Form'd to delight at once and lash the age: .

Above Temptatio1i‚ in a low Estate,
And uncorrupted, ev'n among the Great:

A safe (lompanion7 and an easy Friend‚

Unblam’d thro’ Life, lamented in thy End.
These are Thy Honours! not that here thy Bust
Is mix'd with HeroeS, or with Kings thy dust3
But that the Worthy and the Good shall say,

striking their pensive bosoms-Here lies Gru.
