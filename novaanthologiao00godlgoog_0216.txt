CXXVIII

Ι love, and he loves me again,
Yet dare I nol tell who:
For if the nymphe should know my swain,
I foer lhoy'd love him too:
Yet 1111 be not known,
The pleasure 10 os good os none,
For that ’s a nsrrow joy is bul our own.

He is, if they ean find him, fair,
And fresh and fragrant 100,
Αο summer's sky, or purged eir,
And looks as lilios do
Theb ere 11110 morning blown:
Yet, yet· Ι doubt he is not known,

And fear much more, that more of him be shown.
Jonson.

CXXIX

Not mine own fears, 11011110 prophetie soul

Of 1110111110 world drenming on things 10 come,

Can yet the lease of my true love control,

Suppos'd os forfeit 10 a oonfin'd doom.

The morial moon hath her eclipse endurod,

And the sad augure mook 111011 own presage3

Incertainlies now orown themselves 1100111011,

And peace proolaims olives of endless age.

, Now with 1110 drops of this most balmy 111110

My love looks fresh, and Dealh 10 me subscribes,

Since, spite of him, I'll live in this poor rime,

While he insulis o'er dull and speeohless tribes:
And thou in this sholt find thy monument,

When tyranls’ 010010 and tombs of bross are spent.
