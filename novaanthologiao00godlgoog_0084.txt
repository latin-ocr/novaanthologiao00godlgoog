Ι arise from dreams of thoe
In the first sweet sloep of night,
When the winde are breathing low,
And the stars are shining bright.
Ι arise from dreams of thee,
And a spirit in my feet
1111111 led me—who knows how?
To thy chamber window, swoet!

On the dark, the silent stream-
The champak odours fail

Like sweet thoughts in a dream;
The nightingale’s complaint

Ι1 dies upon her hem,
As Ι must die on thino,

Belovbd as thou art!

O 1111 me from the grass!
I die, Ι faint, Ι fail!
Lot thy love in kisses rain
On my lips and eyelids¹ pale.
My oheek is cold and white, alas!
My beart beats loud and fast:

Ο prese 11 close 1ο thino again,
Where it- will break at last.
