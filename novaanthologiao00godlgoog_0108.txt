child, when thou wert gone,
I envied human wives, and nested birds,
Yea‚ the aubb’d lioness ; went in search of thee
Thro’ many a palaee, many 0 eot, and gave
Thy breest to eiling infante in the night,
And set the mother waking in amaze
To find her sick one whole; and forth again
Among the wail oi midnight winds, and 011001,
‘Where is my loved oue? Wherefore do ye wail‘?’
And out from all the night an answer shrill'd
‘We know not, and we know not why we wail.’
I elimb'd on all the 011110 01 011 the 0000,
And ask’d the 110100 that moan about the world
‘Where‘i do ye make your meaning for my ehildt’
And round from all the world the voices oame
‘We know not, and we know not why we moen?
ι11111101οὟ and I stared from every eaglepeak,
Ι thridded the blaok heart of all the 110010,
1 peer'd thro’ tomb and 0010, and in the storme
Of Autumn swept across the city, and heard
The murmur 01 their temples chanting me,
Me, me, the desolate Motheri ‘Where '‘t-and turn'd,
And fied by many 0 waste, 10110111 01 man,
And grieved forman thro’ 011 my grief 10111100,-
The jungle rooted iu his shatter'd hearth,
The serpent eoil’d about his broken shaft,
The scorpion erawling over neked skulls ;-
I saw the tiger in the ruin’d fane
Spring from his fallen God, but traoe 01 thee

Ι saw not.
TENNYSON.
