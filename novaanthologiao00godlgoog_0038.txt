Ota. Never, Iago. Like to the Pontio sea,
Whose icy current and compulsive course

You elements that clip us round about,
Witness that here Iago deth give up
The execution of his wit, hands, heart,
’ Το wrong'd Othello's service! Let him command,
And to obey shall be in me remorso,
What bloody business ever.
