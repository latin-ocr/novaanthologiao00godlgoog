Go, sayl sent theo fonh to purchase honour,

And not the king exil’d them or suppose
Devouring postilenoe hangs in our air,

And thou art flying to a fresher elimo.
Look, what thy soul holds dear, imagine it

Το lie that way thou go’st, not whence thou com'st.

With how sad stepS, OMoon, thou olimb’st the skieS,

How silently, and with how wan a fane!
what! may it bo, and even in heavenly placo,
That busy Archer his sharp arrows tries?
Suro, if that long with love acquainted eyes
Can judge of love, thou feel'st a lover's case3
Ι read it in thy looks, thy languish'd grace
Το me that feel the like thy state descries.
'Phen even of fellowship‚ Ο Μοοη, tell me,
Is constant love deem’d there but want of wit?
Are beauties there as proud as here they be?
Do they above love to be lov’d‚ and yet

These l'overs soorn whom that love doth possess?

Do they call virtue there ungratesulness?
