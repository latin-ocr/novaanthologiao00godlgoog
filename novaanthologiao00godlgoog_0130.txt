Forseke me not thus, Adem; witness Heev’n
Whet love sineere, end reverence in my heert
I beer thee, end unweeting heve offended‚
Unheppily deeeiv’d3 thy suppliant

' Ι heg, end elasp thy knees; bereeve me not,

Whereon 1 live, thy gentle looks, thy aid,
Thy eounsel in this uttermost distress‚

My only strength and stay: forlorn of thee,
Whither shall I betake me, where subsist‘?

While yet we live, searee one short hour perhaps,
Between us two let there be peace,; both joining,
As join’d in injuries, one enmity

Against a foe by doom express essign'd ue,

That eruel Serpent; en me exereise not

Thy hetred for this misery befall’n;

On me already lost, me than thyself

More miserable.

Weep no more, nor sigh‚ nor grean,
Sorrow ealle no time thet’s gone:
Violets plueked, the sweetest rain
Mekes not fresh nor grew again ;
Trim thy looks, look cheerfully,
Fate’s hidden ends eyes cannot see.
J oys es winged dreams fly fest,
Why should sedness longer last?
Grief is but a wound to wne,

Gentlest seir, mourn, mourn 110 moe.
