(ΙΙ

Out upon it, Ι have loved
Three whole days together3

And am like to love three more
If it prove fair westher.

Time shall moult away his wings,
Ere he shall discover

In the whole wide world again

Such a constant lover.

But the spite on’t is, no praise
Is due at all to me:

Love with me had made no stays,
Had it any been but she;

Had it any been but me
And that very face,

There had been at least ere this

A dozen in her place.

Lot those who are in favour with their stare

Of publio honour and proud titles beust,

Whilst Ι, whom fortune of such triumph bars,

Unlook’d for joy in that Ι honour most.

Great prinoes' favourites their fair leaves spread

Butae the marigold at the sun's eye,

And in themselves their pride lies buried‚

For at a frown they in their glory die.

The painful warrior famoused for light,

After a thousand victorias once foil’d,

Is from the book of honour'razed quite,

And all the rest forgot for which he toil’d:
Thon happy Ι, that love and am belov’d‚

Where I may not remove nor be remov'd.
