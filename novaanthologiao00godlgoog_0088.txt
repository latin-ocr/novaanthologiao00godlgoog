He soaroe hed said, when the bere earth, till then

Desert end bare, unsightly, unedorned,

Brought forth the tendor grase, whose verdure eled

Her universal face with pleasant greeu;

Then herbe of every leaf, that sudden flowered,

Opening their various 0010000, and made goy

Her bosom, emelling eweet; and, these eenree blown,

Forth flouriehed thick the olustering vine, forth crept

The swelling gourd‚ up stood the oorny reed

Embettled in her field, and the humble ehruh,

And bush with frizzled heir implicit: laet

Boeo, es in donee, the stetely trees, and spread

Their brenohes hung with eopioue fruit, or gemmed

Their blossome. With high woode the hills were

With tufts the velleys and eeoh fountein side,

With bordere long the rivers: that Eorth now

Seemed like to Hoeven, 0 seat where Gode might
dwell‚ ⁴

Or wonder with delight, and love to haunt

Her eaered ehudes: though God had yet not reined

Upon the earth, and man to till the ground

None wee; but from the earth 0 dewy mist

Went up, and wetered all the ground, and eaeh

Plent of the field; which, ere it was iu the earth,

On the green stem. (1οᾶ saw thot it was good:

So even and morn recorded th'e third dey.
