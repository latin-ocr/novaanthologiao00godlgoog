But she, ’midsl seer, behold his kind grey eyes,
And then, os hope came glimmering through her dread,
In a weak voice he source oould hear she said:

0 Death‚ if thou hest risen from the see,
Sent bytho gods to end this misem,
I thank them that thou eomesl in this form;
Who rather thought to see a hideous worm
Oome trailing up the sende from oul the deep,

Or suddenly swing over from the sleep

To lap me in hie folds, and bone by bone
Orush all my body: oome then, wilh no moen
Will 1 meke ready now lo leave the light.
But yet thy face is wonderful and brighr

Art thou a god? Ah, then be kind lo me.
Is there no velley far off from the eea,

Where I may live alone, afar from stride,

Nor anger any god with my poor life?

Or do the gods delighl in misery,

And art thou come lo mook me ere I die?

W. lom.
