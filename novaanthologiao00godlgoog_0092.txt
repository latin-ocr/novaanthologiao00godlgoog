Why do 1 love this man? My country’s daughters
Love none but heroes· But Ι have no country!

The slave heth lost all, save her bonds Ι love him;
And that's the heaviest link of the long chain-

To love whom we esteem 1101. Be it so:

The hour is coming when he'll need 011 love,

And find none. To fall from him now were haser
'I'han to have stabb’d him on his throne when highest
Would have been noble in my country's creed:

1 was not made for either. Oould Ι save him,
1 should not love him better, but myself;
And Ι have need of the last, for Ι have fallen

In my own thoughts, by loving this solt stranger.

Not from the stare do 1 my judgement pluclr3
And yet methinks Ι have astronomy,
But not 1ο 1011 of good or evil luch,
Of plagues 01 dearths, or sessons' quality5
Nor can I fortune to brief minutos tell,
Pointing to each his thunder, rein, and wind,
Or say with princes if it shall go well,
By oft predict that Ι in heaven find:
But from thino eyes my knowledge I derive,
And, constant stare, in them I read such art
As ‘Truth and beauty shall together thrive,
If from thyself 10 store thou wouldst convert ς’
01 else of thee this 1 prognosticatc:
‘Thy end is truth's and beauty’s doom and date!
