' Mailed ee thy heart ie with the usages
0f pomp and power, a few short summere einoe
Thou wert a child, and canet not be relentleea
01 if maternal love embraced thee then
Think of the mothers who with eyes unwet
Glare o’er their perishing children. Haet thou shared
The glow of a first friendship, whieh is born
'Midet the rude eports of boyhood, think of youth
Smitten amidst its playthinge-let the spirit
Of thine own innocent ehildhood whieper pity.

Ο snatehed away in beauty’e bloom,

011 thee shall prees 110 ponderoue tomb,
But on thy turf shall reses rear
Their leavee, the earliest of the year,

And the wild eypress wave in tendor gloom.

And oft by yon blue guehing stream
shall Sorrow lean her drooping head,

And feed deep thought with many a dream,
And lingering pause and lightly tread,

Fond wretahl ae if her step disturbed the dead!

Awayl we know that tears are vain,

That Death nor heeds nor heare distreee;
Will thie unteaeh ue to complain,

Or make one mourner weep the less?
And thou, who tell’st me to forget,

Thy looks are wan, thine eyes are wet.
