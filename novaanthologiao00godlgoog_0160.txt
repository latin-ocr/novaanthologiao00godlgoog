When on his ravishing lule he plays
Strew his temple round with bays.

To 1110 glittering Delian King.

Go, for they eall you, shepherd, from the hilll
Go, shephord, and 1111110 tho wattled ootesl

No longer leave thy wislful flook unfod,
Nor let thy bawling follows raok their thronis,

Nor 1110 oropped grasses shoot another headl
But when 1110 holds are still,
And 111011101 men and dogs all gone to rest,
And only 1110 white sheep are sometimes seen
Oross and reoroes 1110 strips of moon-blanched green,
Come, shepherd, and again begin the questi

Here, where 1110 reaper was at work 011110-

Ι11 this high field’s dark 0011101, where he leaves
His ooat, his baskeh, and his earhhen erues,

And 1111110 sun all morning binds 1110 sheaves,
'l'hen here, al 110011, comes baok his stores 10 use-

Here will I sit and weil,

While 1ο my ear from uplands far away
'l'he bleating 01 the 101101 flooks is borne,
With distant eries of reapers in the corn-

All the live murmur 01 a summer’s day.
M. annom.
