CLXIV

But wherelore do not you a mightier way
Make war upon this bloody lyrani, Time?
And forlify youraolf in your deoay
With means more blessed than my barren rime?
Now stand you on the lep of happy heure,
And many maiden gurdone, yet unsel, ’
With virtuous vvish would bear you living fiowers
Muoh liker lhan your painted oounlerfeil:
So should tho lines ol life lhat life repair,
Which this, Time’s penul, or my pupil pen,
Neilher· in inward worth nor outvvard fair,
Can make you live yourself in eyes of men.

To give away yourself keeps yourself still;

And you must live, drawn by your own sweet skill.
SHAKESPEARE.

CLXV

Weary wilh soil, I haste me lo my bed,

The dear reposo for limbs with travel tired3

But then begins a journey in my head

To work my mind, when body's work ’a expir'd:
For then my thoughts—from fer where I abide-
Inlend a zealous pilgrimage to thee,

And keep my drooping eyelids open wide,
Looking on darkness whioh the blind do see:
Save thal my soul’s imaginary sight

Prosenls lhy shadow lo my sighlless view
Which, like a jewel hung in ghaally night,
Makee blaok night beaubeous and herold faoe new⁴

Lo! thus. by day my limbo, by night my mind,
For thee and for myself no quiet find.

SHAKESPEARE.
